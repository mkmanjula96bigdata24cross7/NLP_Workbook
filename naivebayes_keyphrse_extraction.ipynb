What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.

On the normal dog foods, he\\'d eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day.

It consists of smallish kibble with pieces of dried carrots and peas mixed in. When the bag was first opened the girls ate small amounts of Farm Selects unmixed and readily took to it. Since then they've been eating it mixed with their Blue food.<br /><br />I thought Evie and Piper might fuss with the dried vegetables in there, but they don't specifically target the vegetables to leave behind.<br /><br />The quality of this food is obvious to one who reads the ingredient list. Only one ingredient, that animal digest, makes me cringe a little. The girls don't mind it a bit. For goodness alone I can heartily recommend this natural food, but the price on it is relatively high. Rachel Ray's dry dog food, for example, is about half the price of Farm Stands Selects, and Buffalo Blue is about the same price. For a household like ours with three dogs, the Farm Stands Selects is too pricey  to feed the girls exclusively. We'd feel obliged to mix another good, but less expensive food with it. For those with one pet and for whom money is not an issue, I say you can't go wrong with Farm Selects.\",\n",

       " \"I have a 2 year old Portuguese Water Dog who always seemed to have a sensitive stomach, and a 15 year old Shepherd X dog who was beginning to lose weight, she slept almost all the time, and she was getting very fussy about what she'd eat. (I believe that with a dogs sense of smell they KNOW exactly what is in their food; however they have no choice but to eat what we feed them...just Google what is in most commercial dog foods, and you'll see why your dog may not be thrilled to eat it up...if a dog can detect cancer in a person, they can detect all sorts of other things that aren't supposed to be eaten.) Anyway...I used to feed Purina lamb and rice to my dogs, but I was finding my young Porty was having trouble with it, and my 15 yr old would eat a few bits and then leave her dish. So, I started making their food, and came up with a wonderfully nutritious and tasty recipe. The dogs loved my homemade dog food, and my 15 yr old began putting on weight again, but I didn't always have time to make their food. And, homemade dog food is kind of hard on the wallet. So, I started to research all the natural dog foods out there, compare costs etc. I arrived on Harmony Farms, and guess what...my dogs LOVE it just as much as they love my home made dog food. My young Porty no longer has stomach troubles and she looks great; my 15 yr old finishes her meals and looks for more. Both have shiny coats and energy. No one can believe my old girl is 15 years old. I have told my friends about Harmony Farms dog food, and when they've switched over, they've reported similar positive results. My brother-in-law's dog had always been a very fussy eater, and had skin problems with a thinning coat. When they started to feed her Harmony Farms, she became an eager eater, more happy and outgoing, and her skin and coat condition has completely cleared up (...I'm thinking she had an allergy to whatever was in her other food, which I think was Iams). Other friends have commented on how happy their dogs are at meal time now...and they had all been feeding their dogs premium, top of the line dogs foods AND paying top of the line prices. Harmony Farms products are very reasonably priced. Not the cheapest dog food on the shelf, but, in my opinion, you are buying the best quality food on the market, so it's an incredibly GOOD DEAL! It may also mean you make fewer trips to the veterinarian's office. I and my friends are so happy we have found this food for our dogs. :)\",\n",
       " \"My co-worker that does animal rescue brought in a 'Whole Dog Journal' recently and I was astounded at the feature article for that month which covered dog foods, I had been feeding my dog Beneful which is basically just junk food.  I switched her off immediately, hunted around on Amazon to find an all natural food and this fit the bill, shipping was free which was awesome and my dog LOVES the food, I worried about that b/c I've switched her before and she's been uninterested and I've had to top with gravy, etc.<br /><br />Do your research, it will blow your mind what your pets are eating in regular grocery store dog food, it's typically a high ratio of corn which is a filler.  If you want your pet to live a long and healthy life what they're ingesting should be high up on your list.  I'm glad to have the knowledge now and I really wish I'd looked more into this with my two other dogs years and years ago.\",\n",

Each bag of Harmony Farms is about $20 cheaper than the Royal Canaan.  Hard to fight.  I am a believer.<br /><br />The canned food is great, too.<br /><br />September 2011 -- my dog who has had inflammatory bowel disease in the past (verified by surgery) has never felt better -- she is a wire and has the energy of a 2 yr old dog (she is 7); she is not on any daily medication.  This HEALTHY WEIGHT FORMULA has helped her to thrive.  Enough protein, not too much fat seem to do the trick. I highly recommend it.\",\n",

I couldn't believe how she gobbled this up. BUT after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach. Took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days.

We have two dogs we adopted from a shelter, and while at first, one of our dogs would not eat the food (he had worms though, so who knows what junk he was eating before), he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon, he came to love it.

So, I started to look around and found it appalling that there was such little oversight in pet food manufacture and control regarding ingredients and labelling. I knew that it was NOT natural for dogs who had been carnivores for thousands of years to be eating all this processed \"scrap\" and bonemeal - no matter how the companies tried to \"re-label\" it. I also though, knew how critical it was for animals to get critical micro-nutrients in appropriately balanced levels and it could be equally devastating for someone uneducated in animal nutrition to think that they could just \\'home-cook\\' meals which could leave gaping holes in these essential minerals, vitamins and micro-nutrients; not to mention the ratios of fats, oils, proteins that the animals need. So, I was searching for a company I could TRUST!<br /><br />I found Merrick and have not turned back! We have never been happier and use both Grammy Pot Pie Kibble as well as some of these canned dog food cans - though since \\'we\\' are a small dog we use the \"smaller\" sized cans (cat food sized 5.5oz) The cans are ironically enough - filled with ingredients that you can read and UNDERSTAND. You can also go to their website and find out what any ingredient that may sound \\'foreign\\' really is and why they used it - I found out they were almost always a natural ingredient that is an alternative to a processed chemical. I also found it comforting that particularly with the canned food I could open it and RECOGNIZE ingredients like a potato looking like a suprise, POTATO! Or a pea, carrot, etc. My dog LOVES this merrick food and has never been healthier! Our vet constantly comments on her blood work levels coming back at \"perfect levels\" and she is almost 9. Her coat is really healthy and probably what is noticed by most pet owners and yet not the most \\'pleasant\\' aspect to discuss, is that she has almost NO gas (I don\\'t give her much if any people food either) but when she is given other brands she can be really hard to sit near on ocassion :) .

I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a \"gravy\" like texture and aroma that most dogs love.

So when I would get customers who absolutely LOVED their pets and wanted to be able to feed them healthy food without breaking their banks, I recommended Diamond.  Diamond dog food costs about the same as those commercial brands like Purina and Iams, but contains ONLY natural, healthy ingredients.

This food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers, and I don\\'t understand why there isn\\'t more publicity for this product. Our other dog, a 5-year old English Bulldog with constant skin/allergy issues, was switched over when we discovered this brand, and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn\\'t realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding, but actual balding from hair loss), but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old, and he\\'s eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He\\'s not a big eater, but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him, and all future pets, on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!! Kudos Diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I would never buy regular Diamond brand food. If the bag doesn\\'t say \"Natural\" on it, the standards they are kept to are WAY lower and the quality suffers immensely.

He never does that with other dry dog food, and usually waits to eat after I've given him a nibble of everything that I eat during the day. What makes it even better is the reasonable price for the quality. Yes, I understand that organic and quality US-made food are naturally more expensive, however some of the brands charge double of Newman's and provide only half the taste. As humans, we're usually sold by the nutritious & wholesome advertisements when buying dog food, however I think its pretty important for my dog to actually like the taste of the food also.

She usually gobbles it up the minute I put it into the bowl.\",\n",

No Way.\"  After 3 days they sniffed their bowls and walked away.  So I ordered another organic dog food (Natural Balance Organics) and it came today.  So, half old, half new, by the book, and they picked out the new stuff and left the Newman\\'s in the bowl.  Go figure.  Just thought some of you might like to know.  I am switching them from Iams to something much healthier and I finally think I have a match.  But it\\'s not Newman\\'s.',\n",

For most of my Shepards life I fed her a well known, vet recommended food, and yet she always had stomach problems.  Trying many things, it was not until I rescued, and I should really say she rescued me, and the dog food recall, that I began doing research on brands of food.  After a long investigation, I decided on Newman's Own, not only because there had been no recall on the food, but because of the ingredients, and that the proceeds going to charity. Now, choosing this brand, would mean that I would have to order it online, because my local stores did not carry it, but that was all right with me, because not only do I enjoy online ordering, but I am an older, disabled woman, and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me.  Well, I want to tell you, My 11 year old thrives on this food, with no more digestive issues, and a beautiful white coat, and she loves eating it with vigor. My two year old American Pit Bull Terrier, another love of my life, also thrives on this food, has the most beautiful shiny coat ever, and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is.  I do spoil my fur kids, but their health and well being is my number one priority.  I have just recently switched over feeding my 4 cats Newman's Own cat food, both dry and canned food, and since then, I have noticed the difference in the elimination of hair balls.  I know that I am truly a pet lover, but I believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them, unnecessary medical issues, and all around good health, a good balanced, safe, natural food is the way to go.  I highly recommend Newman's Own dog and cat food.  I also feed my two dogs Newman's Own biscuits as treats.\",\n",

You can imagine the diet she had; Burgers, fries, ice-cream, and the cheapest dog foods on the market.<br /><br />No, she wasn't crazy about Newman's dog food when I switched her to it.  But if you think about how people react to a healthy diet in the beginning it makes sense.  It takes time for the taste buds to adjust and not want the artificial ingredients put into most of the food out there.<br /><br />It has been almost a year.  My dog, Molly, is bouncy and healthy and almost allergy free. She gets dry Newman's fed free style, and 4 ounces of Newman's canned every day.  Her weight stays stable at 65 pounds which is perfect for her. Her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a week.<br /><br />On another note, this diet has made doggy duty much easier. She never vomits anymore. Her scat is always firm, making her easy to clean up after.  She is regular as clock-work.  All these plusses make it more enjoyable to be a dog owner.\",\n",
       " \"Our dog is 13 years old and for the last couple of years, his stomach has become particularly sensitive. We tried various brands of dog food before settling on Newman's Own. Our dog loves it and has not had any more trouble with his stomach. It is hard to find though. I was buying it from a small local organic grocery store but they only carried it in the smallest size and I was paying almost twice as much as on Amazon. Now I have it set up on Amazon to ship monthly.\",\n",

Our little Jack had such severe allergies she was tormented day and night with unrelieved itching...after trying endless other avenues to find relief for her we were to the point we thought we might have to have her put down for her to find relief. Then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities...so we decided to go organic...all her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the Newman's. However after giving glowing reviews for many years, we now have to concede something has changed...our little Jack's itching returned to the point of drawing blood. It is clear something changed and I believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was...we are on the hunt again. I am not saying it does not have good quality ingredients...but if you have a dog that is highly chemical sensitive...this likely is not for you. Too bad...it once was a superior product.\",\n",
       " \"I originally bought this as a replacement for Science Diet's I/D as it was always much more expensive than anything else out there. I/D was also more expensive than Newman's at my local vet's office. I have had a ton of issues getting my dog to accept other dog foods in the past. We tried pretty much every brand that you can buy in pet shops and always had problems with my dog scratching or having her ears get bright red. We found out the problem after one of the cases where she almost went into renal failure after eating her Milkbone treats. We needed something organic without a lot of beef in it. While this one does have some bi-product for protein, it doesn't seem to bother my dog at all. She also has normal stools every time which wasn't the case even with the I/D. My dog hated the I/D. She would often leave a good portion of it on the ground or in the bowl and rarely ate it in its entirety. With the Newman's own it is night and day. She scarfs it down in less than a couple minutes and usually eats a bowl in one sitting. It seems like she loves it from the way she eats it.<br /><br />A couple of the reports from reviewers originally scared me about the reports of scratching which was exactly the problem I had with other dog foods. I gave it a try and my husky has never had a problem since and she has been on it for almost three months now. My husky has always had problems with digestive issues and this seems to be one dog food that she likes and does not have problems with.<br /><br />On a side note, I wish Newman's offered a bigger size bag. I have to order these all the time due to the 12.5 pound bag. My husky kills a bag in roughly two weeks due to her size. It still works out being cheaper than the $50 bag of 17 pound I/D I was ordering so I'm still happy with it. Science diet was sending me to the poor house.\",\n",

It\\'s been about 2 months and she has her fur growing back in the problem areas, she has less dandruff and I\\'ve noticed a lot less scratching from her in general. Our dog trainer said it was most likely due to the change in diet.<br /><br />Her BMs are solid and very regular. They are also not particularly smelly. I have never smelled any gas from her since putting her on the food.

I\\'ve been looking for a good quality dog food (rated 4 stars by dogfoodadvisor.com) without going into debt purchasing it!  I was feeding them a different brand that was \"breed-specific\" food, but was having trouble trying to find it in stock anywhere.  A few places, if they carried it at all, only carried the very small bags (2.5 lbs) and with two dogs, one bag would last about 3 - 5 days.  Plus these little 2.5 lb. bags cost more than half what the larger 10 lb. bag  cost!  I tried to make an arrangement to have one of the places order the larger bag for me, but they conveniently \"forgot\" to place the order, so I was stuck purchasing the ridiculously more expensive small bags.  Then I heard about Newman\\'s Own Organics, which is rated a better dog food than the \"breed-specific\" food I was using and cost $$$ less!  And then I discovered that I could buy this food at Amazon.com, have it shipped on a regular basis to my home with no shipping costs and a discount on the food for signing up for the subscription plan delivery - no brainer!!  No more running out of food, no more driving 50 miles or more to find it, no more hassels!<br /><br />And best and most importantly of all, my little guys LOVE IT!!

I wasn't happy.  I contacted Newman's about whether the products in this food are sourced from the U.S. and I was told by one of their scientists that they are.  Recently, I moved and was unable to get Newman's locally, so I tried a couple other organic brands.  My dog didn't like them and she seemed to have a larger stool.  I decided to go back to Newman's and order from Amazon, who I can always count on to carry everything.  Now she's happy and so am I!  And, we're supporting a great cause, because Newman's doesn't compromise on quality and also supports charitable endeavors.

For a couple of dollars more, just buy real organic dog food. This dog food isn\\'t exactly cheap, so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising.  This whole \"greenwashing\" thing needs to be regulated better.  If someone uses the word organic in their description, it better be organic.  Otherwise the consumer is being deceived which is unfortunate.  Newmans has a great reputation, I buy a lot of their products, but this was intentionally deceptive and it makes me reconsider buying anything from them in the future.<br /><br />On the positive side, my dog loved it, she would lick the bowl around the room for 20 minutes after the last morsel was consumed.

With other dog food products he would stop eating them completely or get sick frequently - even the expensive brands we tried from the animal hospital.<br /><br />At first the only place we could buy Newman's Own was from a local, privately owned pet store which was very expensive but worth it since he stopped getting sick so frequently. I was delighted to buy it on Amazon. The price for the 12.5 lb bag is slightly more than what we were paying for the 7 lb bag locally.

As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers. This was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients. Real meat and rice were substituted with \"meat by-product\" and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be \"unfit for human consumption\". They are taking ingredients that used to be considered \"waste\" and packaging it up as \"healthy & nutritious\" food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not \"sold-out\" yet. The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by-products, fillers, corn or soy. We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy/toxicology verified case of \"aflatoxin poisoning\" from the \"healthy & nutritious\" dog food we were buying and feeding him. This was NOT cheap food folks. This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as \"Natural\", that we were paying $60/bag for. The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer. They are still producing their \"high priced waste\" and heavily marketing it as \"natural\".<br /><br />My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often! Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesn\\'t contain any cheap fillers, it\\'s more satisfying to your dog so you don\\'t need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Don\\'t wait until it\\'s too late for your beloved pet. \"',\n",

VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more.

It is my belief that carelessness and greed led to contaminated small animal food that killed my 2 pets.<br /><br />I have a 65lb German Shepherd/Aussie mix with a leg injury, and joint problems. She has always been very active & full of energy for her age of 8 years old. In the past I've tried either making her food or searching out holistic foods that are made here in the U.S. with natural ingredients.<br /><br />We started out with a small bag of this food at first to see if she would eat it. Immediately she loved it! She had no stomach upset, even though her stomach is sensitive. Right away her coat started getting softer & shinier. There wasn't as much problems with her joints and leg injury as before and I did notice even more energy in her!<br /><br />Now that I've been feeding her this for a while her coat has continued to soften, looks shinier & no more scratching! She's maintained her regular weight without gaining any. Her energy level is amplified and she's showing very little discomfort in her joints & with her leg injury. What I love best is that she eats every last bite of this food when its feeding time, when before she would only pick at her food. I've fed her other brands of holistic, natural and organic foods and none of them were this much of a hit with her. This food really has made a difference in her overall health, coat and energy levels. None of the other foods made her coat this soft!<br /><br />These are bite sized pieces of food that an older or smaller dog would be able to eat. Mine doesn't like big chunks of food, she prefers the smaller bites so this one is perfect for her. Oh, and upon opening this bag the scent is like meat not bread or preservatives in other foods. This food isn't greasy either like many of the others we've tried in the past that leave stains on the floor if it drops and she misses a piece.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this food to everyone who has a small or large dog.

My dogs both sniffed their bowls, then walked away. I'm feeding it to them as its bought and paid for, but I feel cruel doing so. They usually won't jump right into eating it, no matter how hungry they are. They do eat a little, but usually leave at least half in their bowl and that's so unlike them! Horrible dog food. Would never recommend to anyone. Looks disgusting and must taste the same the way my dogs are avoiding it.\",\n",

       " 'These are hard dog biscuit treats (like MilkBones) in a square shape about 1.5\" on each side and 1/4\" thick.  So for a small dog, they\\'re pretty big. I tried to break it up for my little dog, but it was hard as a rock and I wasn\\'t about to try and hack it with a knife so I just gave it to her as-is. This is the only reason I\\'m deducting a star because the ingredients are great and they are good treats but sometimes a full sized treat is too much for a small dog.<br /><br />We have a 4 year old, 9lb mutt who is REALLY picky and not very food motivated.  She has been known to turn her nose up at fish if not prepared to her liking and has literally spit out most grocery store purchased dog treats - especially if they require any effort to actually crunch them to eat. It\\'s like she can\\'t remember that she has the capacity to eat hard foods, so she\\'ll let a bowl of her (very expensive) dog food sit out for 24 hours before remembering how her jaw works.<br /><br />So. Needless to say I was surprised when she took this treat from my hands and ran off to another room with it.  In the other room, she sat and inspected it and played with it for about a minute before she was struck with the idea to try and eat it. Normally this is when she leaves the treat in the middle of the room and comes back to me to see if I\\'m going to give her the real treat - usually some kind of jerky - but to my surprise, she ate the whole thing.  And when she was done she ran back to where we were and sat in front of the bag.  Waiting.  This has never happened with a dry treat before so I have to assume that\\'s a sign of approval from a pleased dog.  I gave her a second one, which she hid under her blanket for about 3 minutes before coming back to it to eat.<br /><br />In Amazon\\'s 6 pack it breaks down to about $3.25 for each package.  Compared to the biscuit treats I had tried before with similar ingredients that my dog rejected, this is on par with the pricing.  It\\'s more expensive than treats I\\'d find in normal grocery store aisles or at the big pet store chains, but about the same price as the stuff I normally get at specialty pet stores.  It\\'s way cheaper than the duck jerky I had been buying, but those are two totally different types of treats so I can\\'t compare the two and this will not replace my dog\\'s duck treats.  The biggest selling point for me is that I have to go to a specialty pet store to find the other biscuit treats with the same kind of ingredients so being able to order this in bulk on Amazon makes it a much sweeter deal.',\n",
       " 'What is \"four ears up\"?  Read on, I\\'ll explain later.<br /><br />The first thing I did when I received the Newman\\'s Own Organics Lamb and Barley Treats was to read the lable.  Darn near everything is listed as organic.  Whether that is good or bad is a matter of personal opinion and personally, I don\\'t even look for organic food for myself.  Is organic food actually healthier?  I don\\'t know, but for the purposes of this review, that\\'s neither here nor there.  The treats themselves are hard and crunchy and about 1\" x 2\" in size.  Each is scored so they can be broken in half.  I preferred to break them in half for all my dogs even though none would have had issues with the size.<br /><br />My house seems to revolve around my 4 rescued dogs, 2 Australian Kelpie mixes, a Yellow Lab mix, and a beautiful Heinz 57, maybe a doberman/border collie mix.  Weights run from 30 lbs to 85 lbs.  At one point in their lives, all of them had been abused and I do know for a fact that 2 had been starved.  As a result none are too picky about dog food or treats.  When presented with the Newman\\'s treats for the first time 3 dogs took them quickly, but not as quickly as usual.  One dropped the treat and sniffed it before eating it.  My lab spent about 15 seconds sniffing before she would take it.  When given their regular brand of treats, the lab usually sniffs for just a second before taking it and the others just grab and inhale them.  At another treat time each dog was presented with 2 treats side by side on the floor, one of the Newman\\'s and one of their regular brand.  Two dogs, including the hesitant Lab, chose their regular brand first before eating the Newman\\'s.  The 2nd time I tried that, 3 out of four at their regular brand first.  That pretty much ended the experimentation and I just gave the Newman\\'s treats until they were gone. One of the Kelpies actually refused the Newman\\'s a couple of times which for him was highly unusual since he\\'s usually the first in line at treat time. The others never did seem overly excited about eating organic but did eat them.  When we changed back to the usual brand they scarfed them down as usual.<br /><br />Now we get to the \"four ears up\".  When my four are really excited about something they will sit at full attention with their ears completely perked up.  At the treat times when they were being fed the Newman\\'s, they initially started out with perked ears then once they found out what they were getting, their excitement faltered and they seemed somewhat indifferent.  Since there are four dogs with 2 ears each, an \"8 ears up\" would be a perfect rating where they were excited about eating or doing something.  Since, with the 2 exceptions, they never did refuse the Newman\\'s but ate them without much excitement, these treats get a \"four ears up\" rating, pretty much middle of the road.<br /><br />If feeding your dogs organic treats is important to you, definately give thee a try.  Just be forewarned that they may be a bit on the large side for small dogs and they do seem harder and crunchier than some other brands.  Given the cost and the lackluster response from my dogs, it\\'s highly unlikely that I\\'ll be giving them the Newman\\'s in the future.',\n",
       " \"I have two puppy min-pin/rat terrier mixes from the shelter and another older shelter treasure, also a terrier mix.  All three love these treats. I use them to get the puppies to come in from the backyard races they get too involved in to listen to me.  And they work! (I have to make sure I don't run out of these - ever.)<br /><br />They seem very hard, but no more than regular Milkbones, and this is probably a good thing in regard to teeth cleaning.  The treats need to be broken in half, but are scored to make it easy.  They are also somewhat large (approximately 1.5 inch square) for the puppies but I don't mind that so much since the treats are organic and apparently much more appealing than regular dog food.<br /><br />I will continue to buy these on Amazon.  Our local Wal-Mart does not carry them and our pet store is asking $2 more per bag than Amazon.\",\n",
       " 'This review is based on my impression of the Newman\\'s dog treats, and the reaction of my two dogs. The variables:<br /><br />1) I have two Lhasapoos (mixed breed), almost 13 yrs old, with healthy teeth.<br />2) One is 13 lbs & one is 11 lbs, comparable in size to a large (not fat) house cat.<br />3) They are fed dry dog food, which is left in a feeder, so they eat whenever they like -- even so, they only eat small amounts.<br />4) When they are given a \"treat,\" it\\'s not all the time, and they receive either a dog biscuit or a raw-hide stick -- never people food.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the Newman treats didn\\'t smell any differently than their usual dog biscuits, and I was concerned with the large size. I noticed they had an indentation in the middle, but only a few biscuits were easy to break in half; most of them were just too hard to snap -- and I have strong hands...I can\\'t imagine someone with arthritis being able to break one of these in half. The Newman treats are a great size for a bigger breed, like a golden retriever, for instance.<br /><br />I put the Newman biscuits in the same canister that I use for other treats, even though the bag is resealable. I wasn\\'t sure if the bag would affect my dogs\\' reactions to a new treat. By the way, I did read all the ingredients on the bag & it all looked healthy to me. I didn\\'t see a reason why the dogs wouldn\\'t like the treats.<br /><br />I gave them half a piece each, after their morning potty break; they do not eat at night because they sleep in our bedroom with the door closed. They appeared very excited until the pieces were in their mouths, and then both dogs spit the pieces out & stared at me like I just tried to feed them dirt. I told them, \"you\\'re not getting anything else for a treat,\" and walked away; they reluctantly ate the pieces. Over the past week or so, I\\'ve given them a whole biscuit every other day. They always eat them, but they don\\'t wolf them down (no pun intended, really) they way they do with their <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EBIP5W\">Milk-Bone Biscuits for Small Dogs</a>.<br /><br />Perhaps it is a texture issue? Too bad my dogs can\\'t tell me...not to give TMI, but I am the one who does \"poop patrol\" in the backyard & the biscuits don\\'t seem to have affected the consistency or size of the poop. (Look, I don\\'t normally review dog food -- I\\'m not sure what other dog owners would be concerned about LOL)<br /><br />Anyway, I don\\'t recommend this product for dogs under 25 lbs, or dogs with weak teeth or dental problems that could affect crunching-ability.',\n",
       " '\"Bottom Line Up Top\":  While individual tastes may vary, this healthy and humanely produced dog food is a real treat that bot you can your dog will feel good about; you in your head and heart, the dog in a very happy tummy.<br /><br />This is \"one cookie\" (Newman\\'s great line in \"The Young Philadelphians) that was a HUGE hit with our 14-year old Golden Retriever, \"Sadie, The Wonder Dog.\" After some circumspect sniffing and tentative gnawing, Sadie got into these in a major way.  Yes, they\\'re crunchy, but Sadie had no trouble chewing it up and gave us the patented \"Retriever Look\" signaling she wanted MORE.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />The treats are about 1\" by 2\" and are scored so that they can be broken in half.  THe ingredient list reads like something you\\'d find at a California health food retreat (well, except fo rthe meat):<br /><br />Organic barley, Organic lamb, Organic carrots, Organic apples, Organic palm oil, Organic molasses.<br /><br />In the interest of full disclosure I should tell you that Sadie is not very particular when it comes to food. Not at all. Oranges, cherry plums, lettuce, bok choy, and tofu(!) are cherished by her; she holds the bok choy with both paws as if it were a bone. She\\'s not totally easy (she refuses to eat spinach--probably some early puppy experience), but calling her the goat of Goldens would not be a cheap shot.<br /><br />However, it\\'s important that Sadie stay away from typical canine snacks, especially at her age. She has arthritis, and a poor diet has been linked to a number of disorders in older dogs. Fortunately, our vet has warned us about this, and it\\'s become necessary to tell a certian neighbor to stop feeding her raw hamburger, baked potatoes with sour cream, bacon, etc.<br /><br />Now, I don\\'t want to guilt-trip anyone over what they\\'re feeding their pooches, but here\\'s a (partial) list of culinary \"BAD DOGS\" that you won\\'t find in Newman\\'s pet foods. (The following--and MORE--can be found at [...]. WARNING: The following contains graphic descriptions of typical dog food ingredients.  HIDE YOUR CHILDREN.<br /><br />NO Poultry by-products - Ground, rendered, cleaned slaughtered poultry carcass parts such as necks, feet, lymph nodes, undeveloped eggs and intestines (and a small amount of feathers). The quality is very inconsistent between batches. Note: By product meals are often derived from 4-D meat sources - defined as food animals that have been rejected for human consumption because they were presented to the meat packing plant as \"Dead, Dying, Disabled or Diseased\".<br /><br />NO Chemical fertilizers - Chemical fertilizers have been incriminated in serious health problems in animals and are not allowed in organic-certified products.<br /><br />NO Antibiotics or steroids - Long-term daily administration may result in a compromised immune system, muscle wasting, and destruction of the friendly bacteria living in the intestines that aid the digestion of food and assimilation of nutrients.<br /><br />NO Chemical additives or artificial preservatives - Chemical antioxidants, such as ethoxyquin, BHT or BHA, that were designed to extend the shelf life and reduce fat spoilage (rancidity) of pet foods may cause allergic reactions and affect liver and kidney functions.<br /><br />NO Artificial Colors and Dyes - Coloring agents provide an artificial \"rich and meaty\" look to modify the appearance of highly processed foods and make them more appealing to pet owners.<br /><br />As if this weren\\'t enough, 100\\'s of thousand of dollars are donated by the Newman Foundation to animal advocates (lest you think this means radical animal activists, we\\'re talking mainstream things like animal shelters, etc. Details available at the website above).<br /><br />Sadie says, \"Give it a try!\"',\n",
       " \"First of all, our dog Sheila cannot get enough of these. Seriously, I just got a 10-ounce bag today and she got very greedy after getting a taste. This is a healthy, organic treat that we don't have to feel guilty about feeding (in moderation) to our three year old pointer.<br /><br />My wife and I try to provide good nutrition for our dog. Corn, wheat, and soy are basically useless filler when it comes to dogs. They can't digest it, and furthermore many dogs are allergic to wheat. These Newman's Own Ranch Style treats do not contain any of those ingredients. They also do not contain any artificial additives, not for flavoring or coloring.<br /><br />Also important: these treats are NOT a product of China. I would sooner prepare all my dog's food from scratch than feed her any dog food/treats produced in China. These treats are a product of New Zealand.<br /><br />Grains are not an essential part of a dog's diet, but the one grain included in these treats - organic barley - is (from what I understand) generally an acceptable one. It's the first ingredient, followed by lamb, carrots, apples, palm oil, and molasses. Again, all organic. And that's it - very simple.\",\n",
       " 'I have a small dog who is finicky and most treats/dog food gives her diarrhea.  She loves pupperoni and will carry around a beggin strip for hours and rarely eat one.  With milk bones, she whines and tries to bury them in the sofa cushions and finally after a day or two, maybe, eat them.  All this is said so you can see just how finicky she is.  She really does not like anything hard.  These treats are thick and rectangular with a score down the middle so you can break them in to two squares.  I broke one and my dog carefully took it from my hand and then looked at me as if to say \"now what\".  She set it down, looked at me again and then picked it up again.  She didn\\'t try to bury it like she does with milk bones but tried to eat it.  Several minutes went by as she gnawed away, making no progress.  I took it away from her and the outside was a little softer but the biscuit was still too hard.  She really wanted it back so I let her work on it a little longer.  She still hadn\\'t managed to get any off of it so I took it away and soaked it in warm water for a couple of minutes.  This softened it just enough that she munched it down.<br /><br />The next time I offered her one of these treats, she held it in her mouth for a few minutes and the next thing I hear is crunching!!  She loves them.  She\\'s missing a lot of teeth and is still able to crunch these down.  These treats are never hauled around the house and I have not found one in the sofa or her bed.<br /><br />I really like the ingredient list: lamb, apple (her favorite), carrots - natural stuff that I recognized and NO corn.

Uh, sure, I feel really emotional about this item and I absolutely love it, can\\'t you just picture me sitting here chewing on one of these treat biscuits?<br /><br />I suppose I shouldn\\'t joke too much here since there\\'s been stories of some people eating dog food for years, but really, I\\'m the human in the animal+human equation here and my opinion really isn\\'t the one that matters for this product.  What matters is what the doggie thinks, or how she seems to react to being given one of these treats.  It\\'s here that things remain tough though as the family dog behaves like many dogs do -- if it\\'s at all edible, and heck, for a lot of things that aren\\'t (like her stuffed toys that all die quick deaths), she\\'ll have it gone so quickly you question whether she ever even tasted whatever it was you gave her.<br /><br />With that said, these dry biscuits do tend to slow her down a little, at least compared to some of the other treats we might give her.  (For example: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OUOYH6\">Cardinal Laboratories Pet Botanics Training Rewards Treats, Beef 20 Ounces</a>).  Being dry, she\\'s got to slow down a bit and crunch up these treats.  In our case, with a smaller dog (Pomeranian), she really has to crunch things up, even if we break these biscuits apart (they come as breakable bars with two smaller portions in each bar).  A larger dog wouldn\\'t have that much work to do, or at least I doubt they would.  I\\'ll find out a bit later as I intend to take a few of these treats over to my lady friend\\'s house where her much bigger family dog can give them a try.<br /><br />Realistically, the Newman\\'s Own brand is one that I enjoy supporting.  They have a good reputation for me and their products are always good.  These dog treats seem to be yet another good example of that.',\n",

So I was skeptical of a natural doggie treat.<br /><br />These a pretty good sized treats. They are scored down the middle, so you could theoretically break it in two for a smaller treat or smaller dog. They are pretty hard and pretty dry though, so it might be tough. If you have a dog with gum or tooth problems, this is definitely not the treat for you.<br /><br />But the most important thing is that the dog likes them.

When I first gave him this he took it in his mouth, ran over to his treat-eating spot, and then dropped it and looked at it, not sure what to make of it.

       " 'The bottom line is that I recommend these treats.<br /><br />We\\'ve been feeding our dogs organic food and treats for years. Our pooches were just as happy to eat Newman\\'s Own Lamb and Barley Dog Treats as they do their regular organic treats. Taste wise, they seem to rate 5 stars.<br /><br />Take note that these treats are hard. If your pooch is a gulper, you might need to break it into pieces. Our dogs are all chewers and took their time right down to licking the floor to get the crumbs.<br /><br />Price wise, these treats cost slightly more than the organic brands I usually buy. It appears Amazon will eventually provide these through the \"Subscribe and Save\" program. If / when that happens, the 15% discount will bring these down in price. Until then, I\\'m knocking off one star for price.<br /><br />If you question whether, in general, it\\'s worth paying a premium price for organic foods and treats, read on.<br /><br />Treat prices and ingredient quality vary wildly. Higher quality almost always equals higher price. Products certified \"organic\" usually add yet another premium.<br /><br />Whether or not you buy organic pretty much depends on whether or not you\\'ve given thought to what your dog is eating. In our case, we admitedly gave it little thought. At the super market we always bought name brand foods and treats and figured that doing so made us good gaurdians.<br /><br />Oliver, our 8 year old dachsund, suffered loose stools and had trouble keeping down food for years. After a really bad case of him having the runs, it was recommended that we try changing his diet to certified organic products containing no wheat or corn.<br /><br />We learned that grains used in most super market dog food and treats are often a mixture of wheat and corn said to cause allergies that can cause stomach problems.<br /><br />Additionally, products not certified organic are allowed to be inconsistent. Between batches, the amount of meat by-products can vary wildly.  By-products include lungs, spleen, kidneys, brain, liver, blood, bone, and stomach and intestines.<br /><br />Also, non-organic pet food can be leagally made from meat sources rejected for human consumption. Shockingly, even brand name pet food manufacturors are often a legal dumping ground for dead, dying, disabled and deseased animals.<br /><br />Making the change to all organic food and treats made a difference with Olliver in just a few days. It\\'s been years now since I\\'ve had to clean up one of his messes.<br /><br />Olliver\\'s canine housemates had no qualms eating the lower grade food. While they don\\'t seem to care we made the choice to feed them better, we sure feel better knowing what it is they\\'re really eating.',\n",

(They get plenty of attention though, trust me!)<br />These treats are the stiff biscuit type. I\\'m not really sure what they mean by \"Ranch Style\". It made me think they were going to smell like ranch dressing...but they didn\\'t. At first neither one of my dogs ate the treats, but then, ofcourse, there was the whole \"You gonna eat that?\" showdown so they had to eat the treats just to keep the each other from getting theirs. After they ate them they came back to the pantry to beg for more. Now when I get the bag out they like them enough to catch them when I toss the treats in the air and gobble them down immediately.<br />I like that these are all natural. With a lot of dog food products on the market, the stuff that goes into them is so nasty that I don\\'t even want to touch it with me bare hands. Not a problem with these.',\n",
       " \"I will keep this short and sweet.  I have 2 dogs.  One (a fox terrier) can eat anything and suffer no ill effects, at least none I have noticed.  The other (a greyhound) will do poorly if given crap treats like Pupperoni or Beggin' Strips.  This Newman's Lamb and Barley treats was very welcome in my house.  The ingredients are organic, and Barley is one of the easiest to digest grains for dogs. So much better than corn fillers and chemicals they add to food.  When you feed your dog food that is colored yellow, red, or green, you are feeding them useless and unhealthy junk.  That doesn't happen with these treats.<br /><br />The biscuits were about the size of a domino, but thicker. Yep, they were a bit hard to break in half, but when my dogs can crush tennis balls in their mouths, these treats are nothing for them to chew and enjoy.<br /><br />Bottom line was that it did not give my greyhound diarrhea or gas, so that is a big 5 star in my book.  Plus, I like the fact that it isn't junk goodies, but has quality ingredients.  Thanks Newman!\",\n",

My vet agreed, and said that the yogurt was an excellent addition.  He also has standard poodles as his personal pets.<br /><br />As poodle owners know, the breed can be susceptible to a horrible stomach condition called \"bloat.\"  Feeding your poodle a top grade dog food on a regular schedule is very important for these lovely animals.  This dog food fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />It is interesting that this is an adult dog food, but the kibble is smallish, and if mixed with the warm water while the dog is a puppy, it can be used throughout the dog\\'s life, once he/she is weaned.

My poor dog has been through a lousy time.  She was drinking massive amounts of water. I had her kindeys and blood sugar checked.  She was ok there.  Last month, I changed her to California Naturals because it costs less and I can get it at a cheaper store. She has stopped vomiting and doesn't drink as much water.  I didn't even think about it, until I was reading the reviews online and saw the same symptoms in other people's dogs.  I will not go back to Canadae.  Keep away from this crappy dog food.  If your dog is the least bit sensitive, it will create toxic effects for your dog. It is poisonious to those dogs with allergies.\",\n",
       " \"We fed Canidae to our two dogs for almost 5 years--they always ate it eagerly, never had stomach upset, and got raves from the vet for their muscle, weight, and coats.  It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.  Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com.\",\n",
       " \"We adopted Penelope, a 6 mo. old min pin hound mix, a couple weeks ago. We decided to switch her from Purina Pro Plan w/ Shredded Chicken to a premium food. After reading many conflicting reviews on this site and elsewhere, we decided to try Canidae. My sister feeds Canidae with great results and, at our local pet store, it is the cheapest of the premium foods by a narrow margin.<br /><br />We mixed only a little Canidae into Penny's kibble. My guess is about 6-8 pieces or 1/12 of her total breakfast/dinner. We watched her very closely. Within a day, we noticed some changes. First of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. No biggie. She also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). More importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. This continued sporadically for another day and half. It wasn't constant or serious. She didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. Still, it was VERY clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of Canidae per day. Having read the reviews of Canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. We made the decision to switch right away.<br /><br />After a lot of research, we decided to try Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken for Puppies. We mixed in the Solid Gold at the same proportions as the Canidae. The nibbling stopped immediately. No sneezing, either. Her focus seems to have improved as well, though I can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. Still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.<br /><br />If you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. Some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. Indeed, I am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that NO food works for ALL dogs. That said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new Canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. Who knows why (Canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? Feel free to try Canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. Or, better yet, do what I wish I did, and just start with a different brand. There is nothing special about the Canidae ingredients list, so why risk it?\",\n",

I went through 2 bags and couldn't understand why my dog was consistently producing loose stools, when she never had before.  Randomly, I found 1 bag of the old formula left at my local dealer so I bought it.  Immediately her stools firmed up.  Now I am again on a bag of the new formula, and again my dog is sick.

Canidae made major changes to their ALS formulas and did nothing to alert the public until they had to (their web site only).

Poop is still poop, but the smell is minimal.  I have noticed it also quickly disinigrates into the ground when it rains.  With the cheap food, it smelled like rank dog poop! Would make you retch and gag!  And there was so much of it!  Less poop, firmer stools with barely any odor, less food consumed per day.  AND NO BAD BREATH from your dog!

       " '**Update: March 2012**  I still feed this grain free kibble to my shelties, they still love it and I\\'m still very happy with it.  I\\'ve found a way to eliminate gas in my younger sheltie - mixing the dry kibble with a bit of hot water and letting it sit for 5 minutes before feeding the furry kids.  For some reason, my younger sheltie\\'s tummy finds this easier to digest and now he doesn\\'t have gas at all.  Woohoo!  So now I\\'m able to feed more of this kibble, they get twice as much of it than they used to.  I think I\\'ve been feeding this Canidae Grain Free to my dogs for almost 5 years now, and my dogs have never had an upset tummy.<br /><br />By the way, buying directly from Amazon for this item says \"Usually ships in 3 to 4 weeks\", but 1-2 days after I order I\\'ll get an update email from Amazon saying something like \"Good news - We\\'re able to ship this sooner than we thought!  Your item will be delivered a week from the date you ordered.\"  And sure enough, it arrives within a week of ordering.<br /><br />**Original review**<br />I feed my dogs the Canidae grain-free All Life Stages food (now called Canidae pureElements, I don\\'t think Amazon has updated the photo or name of this food yet but the ingredients haven\\'t changed) - why the Grain Free variety?  My younger sheltie has epilepsy.  Gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers, so I feed both my shelties a wheat, corn, & gluten free diet.  Canidae is only part of that diet;  I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4\" piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals.  The last meal is sometimes another 1/4 cup of Canidae instead of veggies.  I know, it\\'s complicated, right?  But my dogs really do better on a mostly raw diet like this.  I still use kibble because it\\'s the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty.<br /><br />I\\'ve fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had anal gland problems where she\\'d have an anal sac blowout at least once a month.  So gross, but that\\'s why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed.  (Gosh I hope you\\'re not eating lunch while you read this review.)  Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has anal gland issues.  Their teeth are cleaner too.<br /><br />I didn\\'t want this to turn into a \"raw food is the only way to go\" preaching session, I swear!  But for my dogs, raw is better - it\\'s easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn\\'t gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her anal glands work like they\\'re supposed to.  Canidae doesn\\'t help my dogs\\' particular issues like raw does.<br /><br />However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae\\'s taste, they inhale it.  If your dog doesn\\'t have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food.  For my dogs\\' sensitive systems, it\\'s a 4-star food.<br /><br />The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs\\' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles.  I\\'ve fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid.  So, I\\'ve stuck with Canidae\\'s grain free ALS.<br /><br />I\\'ve also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it.  The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right?  I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don\\'t care for the smell of fish like the pups do.<br /><br />As I write this, Amazon\\'s price is the same as my local natural pet store.  As much as I\\'d like to support local business, my local natural pet store is terrible (it\\'s a long story), so I buy Canidae here on Amazon.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken meal, turkey meal, lamb, potatoes, peas, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), lamb meal, ocean fish meal, tomato pomace, natural flavor, choline chloride, suncured alfalfa meal, inulin (from chicory root), lecithin, sage extract, cranberries, beta-carotene, rosemary extract, sunflower oil, yucca schidigera extract, dried enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried lactobacillus casei fermentation product, dried lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, niacin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D3 supplement, folic acid, papaya, pineapple.',\n",
       " \"I have a Goldendoodle and felt he was a little on the thin side, so I started researching dog foods. I found that what he was on, was not really good for him. The second ingredient was ground corn and I found out that shouldn't be in the dog food at all. It's all filler, non-digestible...filler in, filler out. Through this surfing and sifting of information, what was good, explanation of terms, and eager for any information I could get and then pursue, I ended with Canidae All Life Stages Dry. There were others under consideration, but considering cost, balanced with good nutrition, supplements included in the food, and availability, I opted for Canidae.<br /><br />Of the top five ingredients, before the fat (in this case chicken fat), three are animal protein meal, Chicken, Turkey and Lamb meals. The other two ingredients are Brown and White rice, good easily digestible grains. My understanding is dog food is weighted and the ingredients listed based on that weight prior to them being reduced in the cooking process. Meaning when your ingredient list - lists chicken first, that is precooked weight. After cooking the water and some of the nutrients and calories are lost in the process and if the same ingredients were measured for listing after cooking, the ingredient list would not come out looking as good. Chicken might not be as high in the list. If a 'chicken meal' is listed, they start with the same grade of chicken, generally speaking, however meal is weighted and listed after it has been cooked down. This is the same for any 'meal' protein. A 'meal' protein is just the protein you end up with after it is cooked down, the water cooked out of it. So a 'meal' protein in the ingredient list is a good grade meat protein, which won't be reduced by the processing of the ingredients together. Five lbs. of chicken, may end up to be 4lbs, however 5lbs of 'chicken meal', stays 5lbs.(this is made up example for clarity, not based on any math or science). The ingredients go on to list additional herring meal, vitamins, probiotics (for good intestinal health), natural preservatives and supplements like amino acids and calcium to name a couple.<br /><br />Beforehand, Riley was less than excited about meal time. He would pick at it almost from the beginning, walk away, come back - a little more eating and allot of drinking. Now, he eats it.<br /><br />A big benefit and another part of the reason for a search, is the reduction in feces. He was going 6 or 7 times a day and no small amount. We are down to two - four times/day so far. Improvement in condition of feces also. Firmer, more normal coloring, less of it. It seems like his body is getting more out of his food.<br /><br />He seems to have an improved activity level. His playfulness is increased, but not hyper by any means. Just healthier? perhaps. Calms right down on command, even around the other dogs.<br /><br />So far so good for this change. I have read that poor results can happen after weeks or months of a change, but so far so good. He doesn't shed, so I'm watching carefully for any new hair loss. I won't wait it if occurs, I will take him off. I certainly would say, conditionally, this is turning out to be a good food for my dog and would suggest it to others looking for a quality food.<br /><br />** It's been about 2 months now on Canidae.  Riley is still looking good.  No sudden hair loss, healthy, energetic, eating as I type...Still happy with this decision, and am still using it.\",\n",
       " 'I work for a veterinary hospital, and after the big food scare I found myself calling around to different food companies to see who made an AMERICAN product. And by American, I didn\\'t mean imported products thrown into a food assembled in the United States so it could be called \"made here.\" I wanted meat grown here, veggies grown here, and no imports. FOUND IT.<br />This dog food was recommended to me by a bloodhound breeder. Bloodhounds are known to have gunky skin (must be all the wrinkles) and they are prone to eye infections, allergies, bloat, and numerous other conditions. Well, most bloodhounds. Not her dogs. Her dogs have healthy glowing coats, shiney eyes, and just bring her lots of ribbons in the show ring.<br />My dogs are couch potatoes, but I feel better feeding them something good for them. At first I was worried the smaller bite size might interfere with good tartar control, but now months on this food NO TARTAR. At all, and my one dog had had a tartar control problem for a long time. His doggy breath has never been better. If I could give this food 10 stars, I would. I\\'d recommend this food for toy breeds as well as giant breeds.<br />It used to be when I opened a bag of food I\\'d keep my nose away because the dog food was stinky. Not this food, now, I\\'m not saying I want a mouthful, but it is NOT stinky like some dog foods. You can actually smell the herbs they use.<br />This product is on my wish list at Amazon.

       " 'After reading the book \"Deadly Feasts\" I was horrified to learn what kinds of items may end up in my dogs\\' food! I started researching different dog foods and consistently received the same brand recommendations: Innova, Canidae, Wellness, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover\\'s Soul...etc. I initially settled on Canidae, but also tried Wellness on a recommendation. The Wellness produced loose stools in two of my foster poodles, so I no longer use that brand. The Canidae, however, is perfect for my multi dog household, which often includes dogs ranging from puppyhood to senior status. The ingredients are phenomenal and, as all reviewers have said, the food contains no corn, wheat or soy, all common allergens in dogs. Although I also use and would recommend Innova Evo dry dog food, Canidae costs $35 for 40 pounds and Innova costs about $50 for a 28 pound bag. So, if you are budgeting a bit but would still like to give your dog the best, Canidae is great. After switching my dogs to Canidae, I noticed several things. First, my labrador retriever\\'s coat sheen increased to the point of nearly blinding me in the sunglight; second, he lost about 10 pounds and developed greater muscle tone (although he was always fed recommended portions of commercial foods); third, my shedding dogs shed a lot less than in the past; and fourth, bad doggy breath is greatly reduced. I see no excuse not to switch your dog from a commercial food to Canidae or another super premium brand - it costs no more than a fancy bag of Iams or Science Diet, but can add quality years to your pets\\' lives! If you own a dog prone to allergies, such as a poodle, this food can\\'t be beat. I had a family adopt a 5-pound malipoo from me and they emailed me to say they cannot feed him anything other than Canidae or he develops loose stools and needs to be taken out to the bathroom contantly. For your dog\\'s sake switch their food; you can do a lot better than chain-store foods!',\n",

I sent an e-mail telling them that I would rather pay more for something than have it down-sized.  Their response was :<br /><br />\"Our economy and industry is faced with challenging times, commodities and energy cost are at an all time high and continue to sky rocket.\"<br /><br />They ended their response with this condescending comment :<br /><br />\"We have also had a lot of positive feedback from our women shoppers who love the new sizes as they can handle them much better when unloading them from their car.\"<br /><br />After talking with my dog\\'s breeder, I discovered that the formula had been changed and that her dogs and many other breeders\\' dogs had been having problems with the new formula.

That would have been nice.<br /><br />So, I started searching the internet and found more horror stories of dogs becoming sick with the new formula.  Plus, many dog owners were upset that Canidae did not make much of an effort to inform their customers of the new formula change.<br /><br />I sent another e-mail to Canidae regarding the formula change, their lack of informing their customers about it, and how my dog has been reacting to it.  They didn\\'t address my comments about how it was making my dog and others sick, they just stated that they did their best to post their changes on the internet.  From what I have been reading in posts, that is not the case.  I also found out through forum postings on the internet that Canidae is now in partnership with Diamond Pet Foods.  Diamond was involved in the dog food recalls where dogs were dying from the tainted food.  Maybe since the recall and deaths, Diamond has cleaned up their act and has more stringent guidelines and inspections but who wants to take that chance when it comes to our beloved dogs?',\n",
       " \"I have been researching dog food for a few years now.  I am living in Japan (US Military) and I was ordering my dog food from PetCo online.  I have tried Solid Gold Hund N' Flocken, DVP's Natural Balance, Costco Kirkland Super Premium, Eukanuba FP Prescription Diet, and Hills ZD Ultra Allergen Free Prescription Diet.<br /><br />I was able to source the Canidae and the Solid Gold foods locally for my Dal with serious allergies.  Both of the foods have had better results than the super pricey prescription diets.  I am sold on Candidae.  I pay $[...] for the 40 LB sack, which is not that bad considering I am sourcing it locally on the Tokyo economy.  The dogs love this food more than the Solid Gold, but I believe that they are both fine foods.  This food looks tastier than the Solid Gold Wolf Pup that I was feeding my K9 German Shepherd, and it seems heartier that the Hund N' Flocken as well.  It just looks like it must taste good.  The dogs go nuts over it like a crack addiction!  I am very happy that I have found a solution that is applicable to both dogs!<br /><br />There is something to be said of companies that go the extra mile for our man's best friend.  It is just not right to feed our pets the crap that they sell in the stores.  I used to think that Eukanuba was a great dog food.  Thank God for the Internet!<br /><br />Buy this food, you will not be disappointed!\",\n",

You'll find lots of chicken, turkey, lamb, rice, and all sorts of other good stuff.  Unlike a lot of subpar dog foods, there is no corn!

I know a lot of people who can not afford dog food that is extremely expensive, and yet they don't want to feed cheap fillers or grain based foods. If you are a person on a tight budget Canidae is worth a try. You will notice a big difference in energy as well as skin and coat. A lot of senior dogs switch to the ALS formula and have more zoomies and more energy than on other lower quality diets. Canidae is worth every penny.\",\n",

I figured it would get better after a few days.  In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.<br /><br />I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.  The test came back negative.  My vet thought it must have been something she ate and recommended I feed her chicken and rice for a week to even her out.  I did this and the problem was solved.<br /><br />After a week I put her back on her regular food- Canidae- and the problem she was having before began to return, albeit gradually.  We have now started to see spots of blood again.  This convinced me it was not just \"something she picked up,\" but the dog food itself.<br /><br />Now I have learned there is actually a CLASS ACTION SUIT against this dog food maker for the exact problem I described- in some cases people\\'s dogs even died.  I will NEVER purchase this brand again and am switching my dog immediately back to Blue Buffalo- this time no mixing!!',\n",

We feed her twice a day, splitting up the daily amount. She just wasn't interested and would eat just a little bit once a day. When we switched her to this food, she has eaten her dog food (the whole amount) every day. I also read on a dog food rating website what the best dog foods were and Canidae was one of the top dog foods on the market! This makes me feel good about giving my dog something she loves and it's also very healthy. Let's just say, she has more energy than all of her doggie friends.

I never knew that all of that crap was in the big name brand dog foods. I had always had her on Purina of some sort until I started doing research. I was blown away by what I read and quickly became obsessed with finding a better food without paying an arm and a leg. I refuse to pay more for my dogs food than for our own food. After researching about 30 different dog foods and prices and brands on different websites, I went with Canidae All Life Stages (chicken, turkey, lamb, and fish)via Amazon with free super saver shipping for both my 11 year old Puggle and my new 10 week old labrador retriever puppy. I haven't regretted the change or the purchase at all! I am absolutely thrilled. My 11 year old isn't nearly as itchy, has a crazy shiny coat now, and has ALL KINDS of energy to keep up with the puppy now! Also, the breeder of my new lab had her on Purina Pro Plan Large Breed so I switched her right away and even her coat looks so much better now and it's only been about 3 weeks. I can't wait to see the difference in the two of them over the next 3 or 4 months. They both did get a little bit constipated during the transition period from their old foods to the Canidae, but a little bit of canola oil for a few days drizzled over their breakfast and dinner fixed that until their bodies adjusted. Both are regular now with no problems. Also, during the transition, I couldn't get either of them to eat even one piece of their old food. They would both pick out the Canidae and gobble it up and then leave their old food in the bowl until they were later famished! It was funny to watch!  Great product, great service, and will definitely continue to order the 44 lb bag via Amazon. The packaging was very very poor but that's a different issue. The box that the food was shipped in wasn't even big enough for the bag and the UPS driver brought me the food, with pieces of the box laying on top of the bag. Oh well, I'm still thrilled with the product!<br /><br />UPDATE:  SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, BOTH DOGS ARE STILL DOING FANTASTIC WITH THE CANIDAE FOOD! THE PUPPY'S COAT ACTUALLY SPARKLES LIKE I PUT GLITTER ON HER IN THE SUNLIGHT, IT'S CRAZY. THE PUGGLE IS ONLY SHEDDING A THIRD OF WHAT SHE USED TO AND THE ONLY THING THAT SHE EVER CHEWS ON IS ONE OF HER PAWS AND THE VET GAVE ME A SPRAY FOR THAT.

This food was like the miracle cure and after a year of my poor little girl trying different foods all she gets is complements on how great she looks from strangers as we walk the streets. if your used to high end prices this food is also a value seeing that you get 44#'s which does make a difference trust me. so as for us its a full five star no shedding, great coat, healthy mind and a value! don't be afraid try this if others arnt working out for your dog or even if you want your puppy to look even better.\",\n",

I needed something that would benefit different age stages nutritionally, in bulk, for the best price. This is what I based my research on and came up with this dog food. One of my dogs, full grown and used to eating different brands of junk before I knew what I was feeding him, was not too fond of it at first but got used to it and now he eats it without any issue. My puppy loves it and will overstuff herself if I do not ration for meal times. It gives me peace of mind that they both are getting what they need and I am not going broke giving it to them. My only complaint is the horrid flatulence this dog food seems to give them. I have never experienced that with my adult dog in the 4 years he's been with me but then again he has always eaten the store brands of dog food so maybe that's the issue? Overall, I am satisfied and can live with the occasional unpleasantness for a few seconds if it means they are eating healthy. There is also a NOTICEABLE difference in their coats and health. So that's another plus. I couldn't in good conscience give it five just because the flatulence really is 'room clearing'.......S'pose that could have it's uses for unwanted guests on the bright side.\",\n",

One of the bags I bought was broke open, so when I took the bag out of the shipping box, dog food went everywhere.  The delivery time is also something that needs improvement.  I placed my order on the 10th, and it didn't start to ship until the 17th.  It took a week before it even left the facility.  It is supposed to arrive a week after the 17th, which means it will have taken 2 weeks to get my delivery.

From my research the Canidae \"Grain Free\" formula is as close as you can get to \"natural\" diet without committing to raw food.  Great product and my dogs love it..

I know you can buy a 44lb bag, but that doesn't fit in my container.<br /><br />I started feeding this about 10 years ago to one of my other labs because he had cancer and I wanted to give him the best nutrition possible with out breaking the bank.  He thrived on this food.  He has since passed and now I have 2 more labs.  My labs are 7 and 5, and I have not heard of any change in formula, nor have I ever fed anything else.  I do remember a dog food recall a couple years back where dogs were getting very sick due to a contamination of sorts, but Canidae was never part of the recalled list, as far as I know.  I know all about gas, I have labs, no matter what you feed them they have some sort of gas.  I do not feed my dogs table scraps and use Milk Bones for treats.  As far as I am concerned a little gas is fine as long as it is coming out and is not stuck inside, that is when it becomes a problem.  All mammals have gas, it is a fact of life, to think you can prevent dogs from gas is crazy!<br /><br />I feel terrible for the dog owners that had sick pets.

       " 'If I could give this product no stars I would.  We have been giving this dog food to our dogs for years.  But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.<br /><br />We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he\\'s consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it\\'s red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn\\'t been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.<br /><br />The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn\\'t know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.<br /><br />We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they\\'re having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we\\'ve been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the \"customer service representative\" if you can call her that, simply said \"if you don\\'t like it then don\\'t buy it.\" And then she hung up on me.<br /><br />The bag never changed it\\'s appearance nor did they add any \"stickers\" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn\\'t affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I\\'m sure will not.<br /><br />I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.

Upon examining the treat up-close, I found it to be waxy, sweetish smelling, and so chock full of preservatives that the fumes made my nose itch. The picture on the package shows a white filling surrounded by meaty goodness. The truth is that the filling is barely noticeable...whatever it is. My dogs would have nothing to do with it.

I wish I had had the Internet back then so I could have saved her life.  She eventually ended up getting stomach cancer and dying at the very young age of five.

I emailed Diamond foods, and received an email stating that they and their suppliers no longer use Ethoxyquin as a preservative.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with Premium Edge.  It is a good quality food and it comes at a much better price for me (on top of being significantly cheaper, the bags are 35lbs as opposed to NB and SG's 33lb. bags).  The final selling point for me is that my dog really LOVES her food now.  With both previous brands, she would eat half of her food and then walk away and eat the rest of it later when she got hungry enough.  With Premium Edge Skin and Coat, she scarfs everything down right away.  She even BEGS me to feed her in the morning and evening now.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really happy with my choice to switch to Premium Edge.

I have four dogs now and so the price  on Amazon is really appreciated...Along with the quick delivery.

Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.  I wrote the company and received a response saying their food was ethoxyquin-free, even though there was no statement to that effect on the sack.  Good enough for me.

Not to mention a lot healthier all the way around. So, it did not take us long to decide to provide a better dog food for our two blue ticked beagles.

The internet is a wonderful thing and I am so glad we found Premium Edge. It is a high quality dry dog food that is reasonably priced. You can pay more, but you return on investment will be marginal.

The food does have an odor that we didn\\'t find in our other premium foods, and I do not know the source of the odor (we previously have feed our dogs <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCWAFY\">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Large Breed Adult Canine Formula Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound Bag</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NZPFB0\">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken & Oats Dry Dog Food, 22.5-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The dogs do not seem to mind the odor & happily chow down on this food (they are slightly picky and, when I was in a food pinch, turned their noses up at Iams).  Their stools are firm & their coats are good & healthy.<br /><br />Because we go through so much dog food (120lbs/month), and because of availability issues that I\\'ve had with Amazon in the past, we will be switching to the Costco/Kirkland food.  However, if this is less of a concern for you & if you want your dog food delivered to your doorstep (a real plus), then this is a premium food that is worth trying.

Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.

So I just threw out what little was left of the old stuff and didn't bother mixing anymore. My two smaller dogs had no issues. My larger dog got some horrible gas, like she always does when we go through with food changes, and she seemed a bit bloated and crampy. That lasted about a day or two and she's been fine ever since. Well, old Sadie still has gas from time to time, but that's not uncommon for her size. At any rate, she's always gotten a case of the gas from time to time, just like her daddy (me).

It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.

Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.

I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites.

       " \"For the first couple of days, our dog Moby was only slightly interested in the tug-a-jug.  We kept it out, though, and when he finally figured out his own system of getting dog food out of the jug, he was hooked!  Then we started putting all his meals in the jug instead of in his bowl.  Since starting his meals in the jug, Moby has an outlet for his curious energy and he spends less time in the trash can and in distructive activities like toilet paper shredding because he has to work physically and mentally for his meals like animals do in the wild.  It also occupies him while we aren't at home.  It lasts so much longer than a kong, because you can put a whole meal in it.  This is also great because you don't have to feel guilty about giving your dog too many unhealthy treats -- dog food in the jug works great because the kibble is the perfect size.<br /><br />I was watching the video of the woman who put in a negative review, and as an amateur dog trainer, I think I know why.  If you help your dog get food out of the jug, they quickly learn that the way to get food out of the jug is to bring it to the owner, so don't help your dog -- that ruins the fun of the toy!  Also, it's harder to get treats out of the toy if it isn't somewhat full, so just fill it up with dog food and a few treats in the beginning so it's not so difficult that the dog looses interest.  It also helps to put a few treats in the jug so they randomly hit a jackpot when playing with it.  As someone who's studied animal behavior, I know random rewards are the most powerful way to get an animal addicted to a behavior!<br /><br />In short, I can't say enough about this toy!\",\n",

For dinner  she started crying at the bottle because she got so frustrated with it! I never heard her do that before, so I decided to help her a little.

It\\'s been about 50 min and she\\'s still working to get all of her dinner out, so I guess I\\'d say this is a good toy.

Any small treat works well, as long as it\\'s not his usual dog food.

       " \"Purchased our Tug a Jug after my 12yr old beagle shredded an Atomic Treat Ball. I went with the TAJ because of the sturdy hard plastic and rubber neck and the ease of cleaning it out after each 'session'. These were both issues with the ATB. I did remove the rope IMMEDIATELY after buying it because 1) its not able to be thoroughly cleaned and 2) it is a MAJOR igastro-intestinal blockage risk should your dog injest all or some of it(I've seen this first hand, I work at a vet). Its an expensive, invasive surgery that can be easily prevented with the TAJ if you remove the rope!<br /><br />My dislikes for the TAJ are:<br /><br />*The rope. I'm still surprised that dog toy manufacturers still use rope in their products despite the documented risks to and actual deaths of beloved pets! Toys should not be a death trap. Shame on you Busy Buddy.....<br /><br />*You can't adjust the kibble opening or dispensing rate of the kibbles. My dog figured out the first day that if he picks up the base LOTS of kibbles come out. I do understand this is due in part to my removing the rope, but its still an issue. Its annoying since he's not really 'working' for the food and he's done after just a few minutes, bored again. I've had better success plugging Kong toys with peanut butter or cream cheese and freezing them.<br /><br />*My dog will only play with it on the carpet because of the noisy, yet more sturdy hard plastic. It is very noisy on our kitchen linoleum and I can't begin to imagine it on tile! Blue prefers the carpet for more silent snacking, but this means dog food on my carpet and carpet fuzzies on the TAJ :( We've sort of solved this with making him snack on a small mat/rug that can be cleaned.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I would recommend this toy to pets that are not heavy chewers, as I don't think this would stand up to pits, rotties and other heavy chewing/large breed dogs. Its also a great toy for dogs that aren't such gifted problem solvers(like my beagle) since it IS such a simple design. Also a breeze to clean and fill with the screw-on base for the owner and it will hold a good amount of kibble.\",\n",

By using his normal kibble, it keeps the cost down, and allows me to adjust his meal portion size accordingly.<br /><br />It's also about the only toy he doesn't bring out to the back yard to hide and then can't find it again.  Which sends me a clear message he is very focused on this toy.<br /><br />Even though he's a large size dog, I didn't buy him the large size, in part because I prefer the rubber tug, in part it keeps the amount of treats down.<br /><br />I highly recommend this toy (and toy line) for their design and not making it impossible to use normal kibble instead of expense treat products designed only for their toys.<br /><br />I'd have given this 5 stars if they'd made the outside of the bottle with a rubber coating, or rubber bumpers so it isn't so noisy on non carpeted flooring.\",\n",
       " \"This is my dogs favorite toy. I got this last summer for my very anxious, smart 2 year old pit bull rescue to keep him occupied while working. He is very destructive to his toys but doesn't eat what he destroys. He spends an hour or more a day playing with it , not including while we aren't home. At first I fed him only from this toy, but now he's calmer so I feed him in his bowl too, but he generally prefers to feed out of the toy. I knew when buying he would chew the plastic rope off immediately, and he did. Some come with a nylon rope, which would take longer to chew off. Since I have the large, and the rope is gone, I put in one or more large treats (depending on how hard to dispense I want to make it) and regular size hard dog food and a few small treats that will fit through the neck. The rope definitely blocks well and can be replaced; for me it was easier to put a larger dog treat in to block. With the rope I needed to use small bite dog food because it came out very slowly, and he would lose interest.  Interestingly he loves the enlarged end of the plastic rope to chew on (not good for swallowers). Very sturdy and easy to fill as long as you line up the spirals. He's never opened it. He knocks it around with his paws and nose and grabs the neck with his mouth and throws it around. So far no damage, but it is sturdy and could possibly break something when tossed. Worth the slight risk. After almost 8 months he began to chew off the plastic ring around the neck, which he loved doing, and does attract him to the neck where the treats come out. Recently he started chewing the neck off, which is why I'm buying another, but I plan on using this one until he gets down to where the neck is gone, as it still works and he still loves it.\",\n",

Smaller dog food slides out pretty easily if Bailey gives the jar a whack.  He can get all the food out in under 15 minutes.  I need a puzzle toy that is more difficult so he can be distracted for hours.

Switched to Avoderm Baked Lamb and Brown Rice and she stopped scratching and the fur came back gradually until now she is back to normal. She had cataracts and could hardly see and her eyes gradually cleared and she can see well enough to catch a toy thrown to her. She had arthritic hip displasia and had to stretch for 10-15 minutes in the morning before she could walk. Now she hops right up in the morning and bounces around the house with our two younger dogs (one a year old). We determined by switching around dog foods that the shepherd is allergic to chicken. Just about all other dog foods have chicken meal or something chicken added to them.

My dog is a 40lb Sheltie/Collie mix so having a large highly active dog that wouldn't eat was very stressful I hear many people with toy breeds having the problem but I never thought I would happen with a high energy dog. I was shocked that she hated all other dog food and would only eat a little if I wet the dry food and hand fed her she would really try and starve herself any other way and she was not holding out for human food because I do not give her any knowing the problem would of got worse, if that was possible. I found this food by searching online for food for picky eaters and this came up. I was not hopeful because a lot of the brands I previously tried had similar reviews of picky eaters liking it and my my dog not.

       " 'I wrote a REALLY long review regarding a different brand freeze dried dog food and now I\\'m wishing I hadn\\'t because it probably makes this product seem not as good in comparison and nothing could be further from the truth!<br /><br />When I originally read all of the reviews about this product I was a bit skeptical but VERY hopeful (despite the cost)since so many reviewers said that this was the one food that their totally-picky dog would actually eat.<br /><br />When I first tried giving her a nibble while out on a walk she turned her nose up at it like she does with all new things. I slowly started giving her some, mixed in with a clump of almond butter and her kibble. Eventually I got her to eat it and was happy to have something else to feed her along with the kibble and the other raw products I feed.<br /><br />(I know that raw is not supposed to be mixed with kibble, but in this case I am just trying to get her to eat anything) Anyway, I continued to do this until one day she just didn\\'t seem to want it. Finally it dawned on me that she probably JUST wanted this and nothing else and much to my surprise I was right!<br /><br />She likes it so much that she will eat it without the almond butter, which is a HUGE relief to me for it\\'s literally the FIRST and only food I\\'ve been able to skip the almondt butter with since she first stopped eating.<br /><br />She will get sick of it after a few days so of course I alternate what I feed her; before she had stopped eating completely I had her on a rotation diet which I believe is better for them anyway. The only downside, of course, is the cost, especially if you have a bigger dog like I do.<br /><br />It\\'s understandable, however, since the food is imported and air dried which I imagine takes longer. I love being able to feed my dog a raw diet without the GI upset she gets with fresh raw. I finally noticed that her feces is MUCH smaller when she is on a raw-only diet, and for a dog of 60+ lbs hers weren\\'t that big to begin with.<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I can\\'t say how AWESOME the ZiwiPeak company is! When I first noticed and wanted to try this product I emailed them asking if I could purchase a sample anywhere. Within days I received a package of the venison product in the mail. (Their \"trial size\" is a good size bag!) It wasn\\'t until after the fact that I saw that you CAN purchase that size through Amazon, and it retails for $8-$10!<br /><br />Even MORE impressive to me was a few months later when I wanted to try the lamb variety. I wasn\\'t able to find a similar trial size package of the lamb anywhere online, so I emailed them again and asked if the lamb variety was avaialble for purchase in anything smaller than the 2.2 lb bag.<br /><br />Once again within a few days I receive a package in the mail from them, and this time it included a large zip-lock baggie filled with the lamb variety and a scoop. Apparently they don\\'t make the small trial bags of the lamb but that didn\\'t stop them from sending me some! (which so far my dog seems to like!)<br /><br />To put this into perspective, I have emailed other raw manufacturers asking where I can purchase sample products from, including the other company I reviewed, and many of them never even answered me much less sent me anything!<br /><br />It definitely feels good to be feeding my dog something that I know she actually likes, plus feeding the benefits of a natural raw diet, PLUS a product that uses a drying process that hopefully preserves some of the natural enzymes of raw food.<br /><br />Can\\'t say enough good things about this food - if it was the ONLY food I fed my dog it wouldn\\'t be nearly as expensive to feed her but unfortunately because of her pickiness this isn\\'t the case.',\n",
       " \"My puppy has been on way too many dog foods: Orijen, Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and now ZiwiPeak. Out of the four, I'd say this is the best but also the most expensive. A 2.2lb bag lasts probably 3 weeks at most, but at least I know I'm feeding her raw without the mess of raw. It's not cheap but considering how much it costs for us to eat out per meal, $28/bag for 3 weeks really isn't much on the larger scheme of things. It also helps that she loves this stuff and gobbles it up and we know she's not getting any filler. For those who are concerned that the serving size in the back is too little, we had the same concern. But after giving her more than what was recommended, we noticed our puppy was not finishing her bowl of food each time which told us that she was already full and didn't even want more. So if you're used to feeding your dog kibble, the reason there's less to feed her is because there's no filler and it's just meat, meat and more meat so they fill up on it without having to process things like potato. I've also noticed that my dog sneezes and farts significantly less. She used to get eye stains but after we switched to Orijen and now ZiwiPeak, we noticed that her stains disappeared all together!<br /><br />Unless my puppy has any health or allergy issues to ZiwiPeak, I will never switch her to any other brand or type of food!\",\n",

She got into an open bag that my nephew left out one day, only about a 1/4 of the bag was left, and ate all the rest!  :-)  No need for dinner!<br /><br />These treats are great for training purposes and even for just a \"good dog!\" moment.  I would definitely recommend them.',\n",
       " 'Everyone is giving these such a great review. I just ordered my first bag for my Scottie to replace the brand that he normally goes crazy over that is stopping making his \"duckies\". We were up in arms when we got the email from the company that they would not have duck and yam treats anymore.  Charlie has a lot of allergies and duck and sweet potato is one of the few things that the vet said that he could have as a treat (along with his allergy dog food, lamb, rice, and hamburger) We lucked upon these duck and sweet potatoes in an Internet search. I hope they are as good as all the reviews say. Because Charlie will be very disappointed if his \"duckies\" were not coming after he did his business outside, that is his reward. Charlie is waiting in for his new \"duckies\" to come, and try them out. We have tried chicken and yam but he does not like them as much as his \"duckies.\". We will keep you up to date on the progress on the new \"duckies\" they should be here in a day or two. Cross your fingers that they pass the muster.<br /><br />Just an update; after two weeks of switching duck and yam treats from a different company, Charlie has become a mad man for these duck and sweet potatoes. The other company is discontinuing their duck and yam, so on a whim and all these great reviews we tried this brand, now if you our down one of the old and one of these on the floor he gobbles down this one and just leaves the old kind. What a great find!  Charlie loves his \"duckie\" which he gets after doing his business outside. He now comes in and sits infront of his treat jar and waits. He eats the duck part first then the sweet potato which shocks me, I can believe he eats a veggie. But he loves them, I can not give a higher review then I am now, if there were a way to give 10 stars these would get 11! Great for dogs with allergies too, no filler just all natural products which makes me feel good about giving them to Charlie!  So worth the price, you only give your doggie 1-3 a day and there are a lot in a pack and it is resealable which keeps them fresh.  And they have the \"rawhide-ish\" duck which is good for their teeth and the sweet potato for fiber. I am kind of lucky that the old brand has stopped making theirs because I found these, and no need to run to Petsmart once a week to buy a new bag these seem to last forever, and are a good size for a treat, bigger than a milk bone and smaller than a greenie. Greenies used to be Charlie\\'s favorite now he turns his nose up at them and wants his \"ducky\"  I can\\'t say enough good things about them!<br /><br />I am buying three more bags today just so I have a stock up of them because I never want to run out!',\n",
       " 'I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like \"Beneful\" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food at first, but didn\\'t seem to enjoy it as much as their previous brand. After reading the ingredients of Beneful, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. I try to avoid corn in all pet foods, and as a main ingredients is just ridiculous. Dogs are meant to eat real meat, they are carnivores. Basically dogs cannot fully digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We\\'re talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can\\'t believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging when they are not present in the food; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.',\n",

       " 'My 11 year old lab \"Stella\", loves to run, play, hunt. She started getting arthritis in her hips and the vet said. glucomsumine and condroitan (sorry about the spelling).  I found food called \"good hips\" on amazon and tried it. Then I found these treats at the local grocery store. Then they quit selling them. I looked everywhere and found them on Amazon.  I subscribe to the dog food from Amazon.  Stella is like a puppy again!  I recommend these items for anyone with a larger or older dog, it really makes a huge difference in the quality of life of our best furry friends. Stella thanks you!',\n",
       " \"My 6-month-old bichon frise puppy takes after his mommy in that he's a very picky eater. This is the only brand of dog food he's eaten without making a fussy face. I'm sold!<br /><br />We had him on Royal Canin for about 2 months until we came across Bil Jac. Originally, it was a freebie from our pet supply store. I put it right next to his Royal Canin and the answer was obvious. He loved it. And why wouldn't he? It's made of real chicken and chicken organs, which provides a natural source of fat.<br /><br />I went through the ingredient list and did my own research. Arginine plays an important role in cell division, the healing of wounds, removing ammonia from the body, immune function, and the release of hormones. I went a bit further and asked my vet. He told me that puppies less than 1 year old are unable to create arginine internally, and although it's not an essential amino acid, it's always a good idea to include it in a puppy's nutrition.<br /><br />Bil Jac is slow cooked for over 40 minutes, and that ensures more nutrients are retained during the process. And the fact that there's no sprayed-on fat, corn gluten meal, wheat gluten meal, or less expensive proteins sold me.<br /><br />My vet approved. My budged approved. Most importantly, my puppy gave it the paws up. I'm sticking with Bil Jac all throughout his adult years!\",\n",
       " 'I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it\\'s organic. Real \"premium\" dog foods brag that they\\'ve no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real \"premium\" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it\\'s not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it\\'s cheap, but it\\'s not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real \"premium\" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don\\'t be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company\\'s 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back.',\n",
       " \"I received a complimentary bag of Bil Jac dog food through BzzAgent.com .  Before I could even get the food poured into my puppy's dish, she was already  pawing at the bag trying to get at the food.  She went nuts for it and immediately refused to eat her old food.  This food requires no transition time, so I immediately switched her to Bil Jac and she has had no digestive problems at all.  I have had to start measuring out her food because she'd eat way more than she needs if I let her.  She is only 4lbs at 8 months old, and the small breed puppy food is very easy for her to chew.  This is definitely the best dog food we've tried and the one we'll stick with.\",\n",
       " \"My 11 dogs love this so I say it is great! The tiny ones (toy poodles) get the almost straight food. The others get this mixed with their Bil-Jac. I am impressed with the ingredients.

Not even one of them had it. That's a good thing. I ordered two more cases and will continue. The price is reasonable too and free shipping with Amazon Prime or free shipping with purchase over 25.00. I also ordered the chicken with rice and the dog food for all life stages.  My dogs love them all the same. I had never purchased food with lamb in it before but the one for life stages has it. i do not like the way veal or lamb are treated and have never eaten it myself either. However,having said that, I will be ordering this monthly for my dogs. Just wish there were more choices without lamb. It is impressive that their cattle are free range grazing cattle and fish are ocean not farm raised. I believe my dogs are eating better than us!

I have researched and studied dog foods for several years now and although I believe Canidae is one of better foods out there, Gilligan began having seizures just weeks after he begun eating it and we now home cook his meals.  Gilligan has not had seizures in his lifetime, so we were baffled when all of a sudden he developed a pattern of having a seizure about 3-4 hours after his meal.  His vet said that the pattern made sense to her, because ammonium levels are highest in the blood about 3-4 hours after eating and if the liver doesn't process the protein efficiently, it can definitely cause seizures in the brain.  The day I stopped feeding him the canned food was the last day he had a seizure, and that was about two months ago.  His vet nor I cannot figure out the connection, but my only guess is that it might have something to do with the quality of the meat they use (better than most other brands but still not what humans might consider consumable.)  I must also mention that during this timeframe, Gilligan developed a sinus infection that ultimately we had to have cultured to figure out what it was, and it turns out it was e-coli and the staphococcus bacteria that was up his nose.  Gilligan doesn't have any eyes so when he eats he gets food all over the place (including up his nose), and he was on antibiotics to clear up the infection.  The antibiotics didn't have any effect at all until we stopped feeding him the food (he was on them for about four weeks while eating the food, and about six weeks on his homemade diet.)  Amazingly, the sinus infection began clearing up exponentially after we stopped the canned diet.  He hasn't had any seizures or sinus issues with his home cooked meals, so we won't be going back to Canidae food in the future.  However, for a dog that doesn't have the amount of health issues that Gil has, I still believe the listed ingredients are acceptable and nutritious.

Bad move. When introducing a new food, one should add a small amount of the new to the old and then gradually increase the percentage of new food in the mix until you reach 100% of the new stuff. Not surprisingly Bella got a bout of runny stools after this rude introduction to Just a Wee Bit.<br /><br />Within a week, however, Bella had adjusted to her new food and seems to be doing well on this new diet. I haven't smelled her stools to see if they are less odiferous and have no intentions of conducting such a test. As an added test, I put less than an tablespoon of the Solid Gold kibble on the plates of Evie and Piper. They actually seemed to like this new food quite a bit, even the ever-fussy Piper.<br /><br />Just a Wee Bit is the smallest dog kibble I have ever seen, and I've seen quite a few brands. Ever look at the little paper circles inside a whole puncher? Individual pieces of this kibble are almost as big as those paper cut outs and about as thick as a nickel. Be careful pouring this food because it's easy to drop a few pieces and almost impossible to find them. You'll have to rely on your dog's sense of smell to recover any dropped kibble. Occasionally Bella gets bits of this micro kibble caught in her throat making us think the tiny size of the pieces is too extreme.<br /><br />Finally-  I must admit that, based on the inclusion of wholesome ingredients and the exclusion of junk, this is an excellent dog food. Most dogs should thrive on such a recipe. One on a budget will probably prefer to find an alternate quality food that isn't so expensive. Since this formula is intended for dogs that have allergic reactions to some common ingredients in other foods, the extra expense really isn't necessary for dogs that have no such allergy problems. For hypersensitive Evie, this is a terrific choice. For dogs that can eat anything, it might be considered extreme.\",\n",

Whole Earth Farms is supposed to be an affordable way for responsible pet owners to feed their pets Merrick quality, but it seems Merrick has decided to up the ante based on this food's popularity.  I'm very disappointed by the decision and may have to switch back to my previous brand.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  After deciding to switch from Nutro Max to Merrick Whole Earth Farms Adult Dry Dog Food, my dog literally does circles when it's time to eat.  The food is loaded with good stuff for my dog and it even smells better than our previous brand.  It obviously tastes better, too, because my dog just can't contain himself when it's time to eat.  His coat is shinier and seems really healthy, and on a semi-gross note, but important one, his stools have been much smaller; that tells me his body is absorbing more of the nutrition in this food than the last one.  I actually ended up reducing his food portion because he was gaining a little weight.  That's always a sign of a good dog food...the ability to feed less and the dog still receive great nutrition; that tells me there are much fewer fillers in this food than most.  I recommend you try it.\",\n",

The dog food was also \"highly recommended\" by an independent dog food advisor site that I use.<br /><br />My dogs really (really) like this food and they eat as soon as I put it down (even their morning meal which is dry food only), so the taste of this food must really be to their liking.  Despite the fact my dogs are rescues (and who knows what they were eating when they were wildly roaming the streets), they are picky and with the Nature\\'s Variety, half the time they never ate their breakfast.  Also, I have large dogs but for some reason they like the small dry kibble and this is kibble is on the smaller side.<br /><br />I have also noticed a positive change in their stool.  It is a little firmer and a bit smaller, meaning they are absorbing more and eliminating less.<br /><br />I actually really liked Nature\\'s Variety while they were eating it but so far I think the switch was a very good one.<br /><br />****PRICE INCREASE UPDATE: I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWER THAT THE PRICE INCREASE EFFECTIVE IN THE PAST WEEK IS AN ISSUE AS THE PRICE FOR THIS FOOD HAS ESSENTIALLY DOUBLED.

Merrick Whole earth Farms Adult dry dog food is grain based dog food with chicken and turkey being it's main sources of protein.

       " \"All three of my dogs LOVE this food -- even my ultra-finicky dog! It is human-grade food and full of every good thing. It is very, very easy to make, and meal-time has become a big deal in my house -- they all sit with wagging tails as I prepare it. When I stayed at my mom's house for a couple weeks, her two dogs were much more interested in having my dogs' food than their own regular dog food. I originally bought this food because I wanted to put my dogs on a vegan diet. For the protein source, I use tofu and all sorts of beans like chickpeas/garbanzo beans, black beans, etc. They love it no matter what I add to it. I rotate the type of oil I use, or sometimes I use a blend. When I first put them on this food, I used the serving size they recommend, and my dogs started gaining weight. So I am actually able to use less than what they say in the instructions. I have three 50-pound dogs and I use approximately 1 scoop per dog, twice a day. In the 10-lb bag there are about 198 scoops, in the 5 lb bag there are around 99 scoops, in the 20 oz bag there are around 24 scoops. So from that you should be able to calculate a good estimate of the cost for your dog(s). Of course for smaller dogs you can use less. With my finicky dog, I used to have to stand over him and goad him into eating his commercial dog food (which even contained meat). Now he scarfs his food every time! One other note: I sometimes add some Nature's Recipe Vegetarian formula dry dog food just to add some crunch. For vegetarian/vegan treats, I feed them Sam's Yams and C.E.T. VeggieDent. It is a wonderful thing to be able to give my dogs a cruelty-free diet! And we never have to worry about all those crazy dog food recalls!\",\n",

We bought a batch of the Beef Liver to add a little variety to the whole routine - and oh, my gosh!<br /><br />The dog LOVES these treats!  She\\'s ready to put on a tu-tu and prance around the kitchen to beg for them.  Forget the dignity afforded to canine senior citizens - this pooch is acting like her old juvenile self!  I don\\'t know if they are more potent than the duck or chicken treats, but they sure seem to pack some sort of punch!<br /><br />I made the mistake of giving the neighbor dog a taste.  Now she won\\'t go away!  Every time I turn around she\\'s at the back door looking for more - she certainly never acted this way with the duck or chicken!<br /><br />Did I mention that they were disgusting??  They ARE!  Unlike the other \"flavors\" of Happy Hips these things absolutely REEK!  And forget about them looking like \"beef jerky\" - nope!  They\\'re real dried out liver - mostly little dried square bits that remind me of mica or shale (they\\'re almost crystalline).  There\\'s no pretending this is anything other than what it is - nasty gross protein of the variety that dogs LOVE!  At least it\\'s sanitary and not the dead stuff they like to roll in out in the yard.<br /><br />Yes, I\\'ll be forced to buy these again.  My 14 year old is rather irresistible with her old-lady gray hair, sassy grin, and wagging tail!  They are a healthy all natural treat with no added hormones, fillers or other nasty stuff.  I just wish they didn\\'t smell so bad!<br /><br />December 2010 UPDATE:<br /><br />I\\'m happy to report that Ceilie is still making her way around the yard at nearly 16 years old thanks in large part to the Happy Hips brand of treats.  We were pulled out of town last winter for a family emergency and had to leave her with a relative for a week.  She didn\\'t do well adjusting at all, so by the time I got back home I was really scared I was going to lose her.  I don\\'t know if she had a stroke or just refused to eat, but she could barely walk and couldn\\'t hold her head straight.  It took a week of encouraging her to eat senior dog food (a cut up hot dog plus chicken broth helps) and regular dosing of glucosamine and chondroitin via these treats to pull her out of it.  Now I have to be careful that I don\\'t run out.  If she doesn\\'t get her dose of these each day she goes down hill really fast.  The vitamin option doesn\\'t sit well on her tummy so I persist in spoiling my grey haired old lady with these treats.  Amazon\\'s prices and delivery can\\'t be beat.',\n",

       " 'Buying pet food can and is a tricky proposition.  This review is about dog food, Purina One, Smartblend, to be specific.  You can spend hours; no, days actually, researching various dog foods on line and via various publications.  Name a brand and you will find many who will defend it right down to the matt.  On the other hand, the same brand will have its distracters; folks who absolutely hate the stuff.  If you care about your dog (and you really should not have a dog if you don\\'t care about it or them), then you need to do your research and do what you feel is best for your animal.  Now let me make one statement before I write the review...it is a rather important statement:<br /><br />If you dog gets sick on any given dog food, then for goodness sakes throw the stuff out, stop feeding your dog that food, and try something different!<br /><br />We have, at this time, four dogs.  They range from 9 pounds to 35 pounds and from two years old to 14 years old.  My wife and I have had dogs all of our lives; cats too, but we are primarily dog people.  We have been using Purina products for years and have been quite happy with the results.  We have healthy dogs and we go to great lengths to keep them that way.<br /><br />At present, and for the past four or five years, we have been using Purina ONE, Smartblend - Lamb & Rice Formula.  We have had great results with it.  There has been no weigh loss nor any weight gains - as long as we keep them on this stuff.  The only problems we do have is that our dogs absolutely LOVE people food and they are garbage guts when it comes to finding delicious \"things\" in the yard and in the woods.  People food and \"things\" usually bring on a case of diarrhea or in some cases, vomiting.  We take care that this does not happen but quite often we find the dogs are much smarter than we are and they are all four most certainly skilled beggars.<br /><br />Purina, as far as I can find, is manufactured here in the U.S.  Yes, they are owned by the Swiss company Nestle, but it would seem that the food is made here in the U.S.  Someone correct me if I am wrong please.<br /><br />If you compare the stuff in this food with that of other brands, it stacks up quite well.  All of our dogs prefer this food over other brands we have tried from time to time (more about that later), of course it must be remembered that all four are quite happy with four day old road killed possum - if they can get it.  The lamb seems to have a more soothing effect on them and they do not seem to have the problems digesting it as they do other meat additives.  Now don\\'t get me wrong, they would prefer that we served them baked chicken (their absolute most favored food on earth) each day, but that ain\\'t a going to happen!<br /><br />It should be noted that any time you change dog food brands or dog food mixes, you are going to have some digestive problems with your dogs.  It will almost always cause diarrhea or loose stools.  If you must change brands or contents, do it slowly, mixing the new brand with the old gradually over several days.  This is a pain, but it is worth it.<br /><br />We buy this stuff in the 18 pound bags here locally and the price is a bit higher, per pound, than we find here on Amazon...although that varies from month to month. If you have Amazon Prime then the shipping is not a factor to fret about.<br /><br />Overall, we are happy with this food and will be unless we learn differently or if our dogs start doing poorly. There are other dog foods of equal quality out there and the challenge is to find one that suits your particular dog\\'s needs. This stuff does the job for us.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks',\n",

I will be calling Purina first thing tomorrow morning and ask for my money back and then buy a local bag and see what is what.

The new dog foods with teeth brushing had just come out in our area so we switched her to one.  When we took her in for the teeth cleaning, the vet said she didn't need it.  Yeah!  Then last year we took our new dog Hercules to the vet and she showed us the CET Hextra chews.  Which my dog treated like the best thing he'd ever seen.  So I went home and ordered some.  Amazon had the best deal I could find by far.  6 months later after daily use of the chews.  Babe went in for her annual again and the vet said her teeth looked like those of a 1 yr old dog.  They even brought other people in the clinic in to see her teeth.  They said whatever we were doing to keep it up.\",\n",

I noticed, when I didn\\'t have Avoderm for a week, but did have Blue Buffalo which is also high quality, that my mix began to shed noticeably. When I bought more Avoderm, he hardly shed. That alone, is reasons for Avoderm. We also bath him with Avoderm shampoo which works effectively with this dog food. He is still on Prednisone, and I bought the largest bag of Avoderm available. With my schnauzer, I\\'ve noticed minute changes...no outside odor when she comes inside, breath smells better, even better mood and more running and jumping. She is older.<br /><br />Another benefit, and this is a huge plus, they seem to empty their bowls instead of letting it sit in the evening when they are fed.

To say that something is a filler would imply it has no nutritional value; when in fact corn is a superb source of nutrients. There is a misconception that whole corn is used - in fact the corn is baked and is much like ground corn you buy. When cooked it is highly digestible.We hear many concerns about by-products in pet food. We need to understand how they are defined and what they really are and what is their nutrient value.<br />By-products is really a play on words. Virtually all ingredients in pet foods are by-products. No one for example uses real chicken breasts as we know it.It's neck and backs of a chicken.<br />Another common myth is that meat should always be the first ingredient, inferring that if that was the case, there would be more meat than anything else in the food. Often the carbohydrates levels are higher than the meats because of the way they are listed in the ingredient panel.Meat first is often the first ingredient only to please the consumer look st the ash levels and mositure levels, and ingreident spliting.<br /><br />I have fed Science Diet to my two dogs and I am very happy with the results.

Natural Balance LID Potato & Duck Formula worked quite well for us, but we could tell that our pug was looking for some variety so we tried their Sweet Potato and Venison formula.<br /><br />According to the Natural Balance web site, some dogs develop sensitivities to commonly used proteins, carbohydrates, and food additives. This may cause stomach and intestinal problems, as well as skin irritations. In our dog's case, it was his red irritated skin on his belly that led us to try a limited ingredient diet. The Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Venison formula combines fresh venison, a source of animal protein that most dogs have not been exposed to, and sweet potato, premium quality carbohydrate rich in potassium and a highly digestible energy source. Other key ingredients include canola oil, low in saturated fat and high in monounsaturated fat, as well as an excellent source of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, along with flaxseed, another quality source of Omega-3 fatty acids. The food is completely grain free (no barley, wheat, rice or corn) and contains no artificial colors or flavors.<br /><br />The kibble is a small oval-shaped disk. It's fairly flat and measures just a hair over half an inch wide. My pug is able to eat it easily, although in his case, he pretty much inhales his food and doesn't chew it much. It has a slight meaty smell, which I think he likes, as the Potato and Duck formula didn't seem to have much of an enticing scent.<br /><br />My local specialty pet food store tells me this is #1 selling dog food. I can see why! Our pug continues to do well with this LID formula, just like he did with Potato & Duck. His skin shows no sign of redness and irritation, and just as importantly, it appears to agree well with his stomach. He doesn't get gassy and his stool is not loose or showing any other signs of intestinal distress. It also appears to keep his appetite under control as he doesn't beg for so many treats between meals and doesn't start asking for dinner so early as he did with some other foods in the past. If it keeps him happy and itch-free, then we're happy, too. 5 stars.\",\n",

The recalled products include Venison and Brown Rice canned and bagged dog foods, Venison and Brown Rice dog treats, and Venison and Green Pea dry cat food. Recent laboratory results show that the products contain melamine. We believe the source of the melamine is a rice protein concentrate. Natural Balance has confirmed this morning that some production batches of these products may contain melamine.<br /><br />The recall was prompted by consumer complaints received by Natural Balance involving a small number of cats and dogs that developed kidney failure after eating the affected product.<br /><br />Dogs or cats who have consumed the suspect food and show signs of kidney failure (such as loss of appetite, lethargy and vomiting) should be seen by a veterinarian. We recommend our customers immediately stop feeding our recalled venison products regardless of date code and return unused product to their retailer for a full refund.<br /><br />The products are packaged in bags, cans and zip lock treat bags and sold in pet specialty stores and PetCo nationally.<br />No other Natural Balance products are involved in this voluntary recall as none of our other formulas include the rice protein concentrate.<br /><br />Although the problems seem to be focused on a particular production period of the venison products, over the last four days we have notified our distributors and retailers by phone and e-mail to immediately stop selling and return all recalled Venison dog foods and treats and the Venison dry cat food. Venison canned cat food is not involved.<br /><br />The source of the melamine appears to be a rice protein concentrate, which was recently added to the dry venison formulas. Natural Balance does not use wheat gluten, which was associated with the previous melamine contamination.<br /><br />We continue to work closely with the FDA in their ongoing investigation.<br /><br />Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-800-829-4493 or email [...]<br /><br />another one:<br /><br />Breaking Voluntary Recall News: Thursday, April 26th, 2007<br /><br />Our canned food manufacturer, American Nutrition, from Ogden Utah, just informed us that they are recalling all canned products made in their plant that contain rice protein concentrate. American Nutrition continued by telling us that they added this ingredient to four of our canned products without our knowledge or consent. The four products involved are:<br /><br />Chicken Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Lamb Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Beef Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Ocean Fish Formula Canned Cat Food 3 oz & 6 oz<br /><br />There have been no illnesses reported related to feeding these formulas, however, to comply with the American Nutrition recall of the four products, we are pulling all dates and batches of these four formulas. We also ask that our customers return unused product for a full credit to their store.<br /><br />To make sure that this does not happen in the future, we are demanding from each of our co-manufacturers daily production record of all of our formulas before they are shipped to us and written certification of NO rice protein or any deviation of our formulas. We have reviewed all of our other products and determined that they are free of rice protein concentrate and that all of our other product labels are accurate.\",\n",

       " \"I treat my animal's health as if it were my own and try to not only find the best veterinarian care, but also the best foods.  I've had my dog Brandy on Eagle brand dog food for many years.  I remember when there was the melanine scare, but I didn't have to worry because all of the ingredients were natural and were grown in the United States.  Aside from that, once I changed from an inexpensive food with suspect ingredients, there was a very noticeable difference in her general appearance, especially her fur.  It became sleek and ultra shiny and her body slim and trim.<br /><br />Brandy is now eleven years old and although I cannot credit Eagle for her health, she has had only one minor incident that she's had to be taken to the vet's for outside of regular checkups.  My veterinarian wholeheartedly approves of her diet and is pleased that even though she's getting to be an old girl, she's amazingly healthy.  I used to use another Eagle brand, but since she's getting older,  I switched to the senior brand.  She's getting a tad chunky, but her activity level has changed.  Brandy still is frisky and I do believe a good diet has a lot to do with it.<br /><br />When my vet called me the other day with some test results from another dog, I asked her about the corn in this food.  Everyone is yelling about corn being a poor and unhealthy filler so I couldn't resist asking.  She simply said that she considered corn a vegetable and had little bad to say about it.  In other words, a not to worry situation.

So needless to say, I don't think dogs not eating meat is as big of a deal as we would like to think it is.

After using it for over a year this other brand suddenly made our dog very ill. We did not figure it out right away as he is a lab and will eat ANYTHING. Usually once or twice a year he gets into something that make him ill for a few days. Last time, we did our usual routine of rice and chicken stock. He got better, put him back on the other food, and he got worse again. After another cycle like that, we realized it must be the other food. So we went down tot he local pet shop looking for something better. They recommended Wellness and we have never looked back. After only a week or so on Wellness, Bear\\'s coat got was noticeably more lustrous. Now, almost two years later we still are amazed by this food. I love the fact that it does not even smell like \"dog food\". The ingredients list is totally free of the usual gunk that is in most food. Yeah it is a bit more expensive, but totally worth it. Even his stool does not smell!',\n",

The two have their individual preferences and there would be times that one would turn up her nose on a treat that would appeal to the other. We would have at least 6 different bags open at any one time.<br />Very messy.<br />The Western Grill package gives us 5 different types of treats in one bag and they are all liked by the dogs.<br />We now have a neater drawer and no rejected treats that get stuck in the drawer till a visitor's dog comes over to visit.<br />And, by buying a number of them at one time, we save big on the dog food bills aside from not wasting time stocking up.

       " \"Our dogs love the Freebird chicken apple wedges, but the economic two-pound bag is too hard to find since I purchased them at here-today-gone-tomorrow Costco.  The small bags are a bit pricey BUT they're not made in China.  My brother always insisted that we only buy dog food made in the USA when we had our three labs.  Now I have a beagle and a blue heeler with my guy, and we are always trying to treat them for good behavior.  I found and buy these at Petco.  The bag has more content than the usual packs of Freebirds, and they like them as well, but I didn't realize until reading other reviewer comments where they came from.  Filled with condroitin and glucosamine for the mature dog with hip problems (the blue heeler), I thought I'd give them a try.  Though I don't see any distinct improvement in our 12 year-old Sydney's hips, I don't see anything detrimental either.  They come to the cupboard after coming in from outside or a bath just as before and gobble them down like a kid with candy.  The China factor makes me a little uneasy, especially at that price, but I see no ill effects thus far.  I asked my vet today what she thought, and she said that they're probably fine as long as they're not recalled, but the laws in China are less strict about what they put in their products.  It makes me wonder if I want to risk my dogs being a recall factor if that should happen, so use your own judgement.  All I know is that my own canines love them, and others here seem to have no problem with them either.\",\n",
       " 'These work great for hiding pet medications. Just place the pill inside the pocket, squeeze to seal the edges, and then roll into a ball. I have four dogs, three of which will eat a loaded pill pocket with no problem, but for the fourth who tends to chew her treats thus discovering the pill inside, I simply place a loaded pill pocket inside a bowl of her favorite moist dog food and wait to see that she eats everything. This usually does the trick and she comsumes the food along with the loaded pill pocket without noticing anything out of the ordinary.',\n",
       " 'My dog has to take 1 1/2 pills twice a day.  Before we tried these, we tried cheese, hot dogs, soft treats, and simply stuffing it in her throat. The soft treats would have been great but she always managed to find the pills(which are tiny)and spit them out after eating the treat, same with bits of hot dog.  Cheese worked but it was annoying and sticky to use.<br /><br />We saw these pockets at our vets office and they are perfect.  I can pre-load 14 pockets with the pills and fill one of those pill holder thingys that have a lid for a.m. and p.m. for 7 days.  When you drop the pills into the pocket, you pinch the top closed, then mold it into a ball.  They fit well into the pill holder and now my husband and I no longer have to ask each other \"did you give Betty her pill?\" twice a day anymore. I definitely recommend doing this because then you only have to mold them once a week and they smell bad-like super strong dog food. I guess she loves the taste, she begs for her pill every day now.  She knows the sound of the pill holder lid popping open and runs in.<br /><br />warnings:<br /><br />1-when we first started using these-the dog had wicked gas for a few weeks-horrible but it eventually went away<br /><br />2-if you pre-load the pills into the pockets like I do, make sure to keep them up high.  We left them too close to the edge of the counter once and our other dog managed to knock them down, get the lid off the thing and eat all the pill pockets.  So he got about 5 days worth of seizure medicine!  I had to call poison control!  Now we make sure they are up high and pushed back.',\n",
       " 'My dog loves this. Had to switch from dry to wet food because she has something called mega-esophagus (where the esophagus is compromised) Started off with cans of IAMS and wondered why should I pay extra for \"premium\" dog food such as Dogswell. So I decided to do the research and find out whether the extra 80 cents (80% more than a can of IAMS) was worth spending per can. I mean dog food is dog food right?<br /><br />So what\\'s the difference? Well I found out that dog food that contains \"meat by products\" or any \"by-products\" consisted of not only livestock deemed \"inedible\" under human standards (bones, intestines, hoofs, hair, etc) but it also contained dead zoo animals, road kills, and *gasp* euthanized DOGS and CATS with their (flea)COLLARS on!

       " 'My dog loves this food and the first ingredient is not corn....What a pleasure to have this big bag of dog food delivered right to my front door, instead of carrying it in from the market.  I used to spend 90 dollars on healthy food at the pet store.  This is the best bargain, very healthy and the dog loves it. Also has chondrotina and glucosomine for aging dog... He is thirteen and recovered from an accident I credit the food. Thanks',\n",
       " 'That was my first impression of these treats out of the bag...  dried up owl pellets (yick).  Not that appearances matter all that much if your pet loves the taste but these are big treats and for my small sized dog, that meant I had to break it apart with my hands which was a touch bit unpleasant for moi.<br /><br />As for my dog, he simply didn\\'t care for these at all.  I really wanted him to like them since he turns his nose up to nearly every treat imaginable (including bits of people food, which I don\\'t consider a bad thing) and I\\'m always looking for ways to create a little variety for him.  Aside from his dog food, the only treats I\\'ve found he likes are the soft/chewy Buddy Treats in chicken flavor and dried chicken cutlets (kind of like chicken jerky) which I stopped giving him after an incident last year where he nearly choked on one.<br /><br />I thought these might have been a good replacement for the dried chicken cutlets that he liked so much because I assumed that these would primarily contain one ingredient (chicken) that had been formed into easier to chew treats.  Of course, this is in part my fault for making such an assumption but I\\'d like to point out there wasn\\'t and currently isn\\'t an ingredient listing available on this product.  The closest reference to what these treats contain are in the following descriptions \"Your dog\\'s instinctive nature is to eat more meat, poultry, or fish protein and less grain... Instinct Raw Boost Bites are grain-free and gluten-free - perfect for satisfying your dog\\'s carnivorous cravings and nutritional needs...  Raw Boost Bites are a pure and healthy treat made from minimally processed, freeze dried raw ingredients...\"  For those of you who may be interested, here is the actual ingredient listing in order as they appear:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkinseeds, Apples, Carrots, Ground Chicken Bone, Butternut Squash, Ground Flaxseeds, Montmorillonite Clay, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Dried Kelp, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Salmon Oil, Olive Oil, Mixed Tocopherols with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Inulin, Sage, Clove.<br /><br />Looks like they\\'re really trying to appeal to a \\'natural/holistic\\' audience and I for one am okay with that - in fact, I try and avoid treats for my dog (and myself!) that contain ingredients I don\\'t know to be \\'real\\' however... had I known these to be the ingredients up front, I\\'d probably have passed knowing that my dog already turns his nose up to the following food items (turkey, apples, carrots, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, blueberries or persimmons).  There are also quite a few ingredients that I never thought about seeing if my dog would enjoy as well as a few \\'questionable to me\\' ingredients (cloves??)<br /><br />I gave this at least three stars because the ingredient list isn\\'t bad per se, but they should update their product description to include this information and although my dog didn\\'t care for them and I couldn\\'t coax him into a second bite - he did manage to eat a first bite after lots of encouragement.  That\\'s a pretty big deal coming from a dog with as fickle a palate as his.',\n",
       " \"Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats are just the perfect snack for my Westies.

I will be looking for Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats at my local pet stores.\",\n",
       " \"I've tried several different kinds of freeze-dried chicken treats and, for the most part, they are all so dehydrated that they literally turn into dust in the bag.  You get a couple of solid pieces out of a bag, then the rest you have to sprinkle on top of dog food because it's just chicken powder.  These don't do that!  They have some additional ingredients in them besides chicken (veggies and fruit mostly) so they stay together very nicely.  They are definitely designed for larger dogs - each treat is about the size of a fifty-cent piece (when was the last time you saw one of those?) and about a quarter to a half an inch thick.  But they break easily into smaller pieces for little dogs.  I have teeny, tiny chihuahuas so I have to break these treats into M&M-sized pieces for them, but they can't get enough!  And the bag goes a long ways if you are breaking them down into smaller treats.  These are now permanently on my shopping list for my babies.\",\n",
       " \"These are great treats.  The dog loves them and is willing to perform for them, but if you read the list of ingredients, these are so nutritious!  My dog hates fruits and veggies, but she likes these even though they contain some veggies.  Good way to get your dog to eat her veggies.<br /><br />The only thing kind of gross is the crumbly texture.  These feel like particle board or something, and they fall apart.  Dog doesn't care about that, but it was kind of tricky to carry them around to use as treats.  There was little disintegrated bits in the bottom of the bag which I dumped on her dog food.\",\n",
       " 'My dog loves stella and chewy\\'s raw freeze-dried dog food.<br />These Raw Bites from Instinct are pretty similar (grain-free, raw, freeze-dried), except the size is smaller to act as \"Treat-sized\" bites.<br /><br />Treat-sized is great b/c these little disks can fit into a puzzle toy. Regular Stella & Chewy\\'s are a bit too large for most toys. Secondly, the Raw Bites are a touch harder, therefore less flaky and crumbly than Stella & Chewys. This results in less mess!<br /><br />Overall a great treat and product, just a little pricey (as with all raw, grain-free freeze-dried dog food).',\n",
       " 'The Raw Boost Bites are ½ inch thick discs that are about 1-1/2 inch in diameter.  Some treats on the market today range from hard to soft and chewy.  I would classify these treats as somewhere between those two ranges.  The bites have an appearance and texture of a ½ inch cardboard disc that was easily broken up into smaller pieces.  Of particular interest to us was the ingredients of the treat and we were happy to see that all the ingredients (other than the preservatives) were natural food products.  An added bonus for us was the fact that this treat is made in the USA.<br /><br />In our house, we do \"controlled\" feeding; meaning that each dog is given a portioned amount of dog food at the same time twice a day.  This is in direct opposition to \"free\" feeding (having food available at all times throughout the day).  They are all fed in their crated kennel.  Our cats are free fed; with the food on a perch out of the reach of the dogs.<br /><br />A total of 8 dogs and 2 cats were tested for this review.  Five of the dogs and both cats are ours and 3 of the dogs were visiting at the time this testing took place.  The breed of dogs tested were 3 Welsh Pembroke Corgi\\'s, 2 Border Collie adults, 1 Belgian Sheep dog, 1 Border Collie mix puppy and 1 Golden Retriever.  Four dogs are female and four dogs are male.  Six of the dogs are highly food driven, one is somewhat picky of what it eats and the last dog is very picky of what it eats.  The cats are of no particular breed and both are female.  All dogs tested were fed 2 hours prior to testing.<br /><br />We wanted a controlled testing environment whereby each dog was given the opportunity to visit a small bowl of 1 Raw Boost Bite that was broken up into smaller pieces than the original.  Each dog, one at a time and alone, was taken out of their crated kennels and let loose inside of the house.  Each dog easily found the treat.  The 3 Corgi\\'s, the Border Collie puppy mix, 1 of the Border Collies adults, and the Golden Retriever (a total of 6 of the 8 dogs) immediately feasted on the treat and thoroughly enjoyed the treat.  All of these dogs are highly food driven.<br /><br />The other Border Collie adult sniffed the treat, went away for about 30 seconds and returned to the treat bowl and ate each piece but not nearly as vigorously as the other 6 dogs.  This dog is pretty \"picky\" of what it eats and is not food driven at all.  The Belgian Sheepdog is very picky of what it eats and after one sniff, refused to even try the treat.<br /><br />My two cats live a relaxed life style of sitting on the couch and since they are not trained will only eat soft food.  They both took one look at Nature\\'s Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Chicken flavor and walked away.<br /><br />In conclusion, we were pleased with this product.  Boost Bites do not get a perfect rating because one of my dogs and the cats did not want to eat them.  After the response most of the dogs had to this product, I will be ordering these again for them to act as an obedience training tool.',\n",
       " \"I have six cats an am constantly trying different treats. I try to make sure that they get the healthiest of all foods but this is not always an option. Most treats on the market are glorified potato chips for cats.<br /><br />The first think I noticed is these treats smell. Not horribly, but you can tell there is real food in them. They are a 1 ½ in circular biscuit. The perfect size for a dog, but I have to break it into six pieces for my cats. When breaking the biscuit up, it tends to crumble.<br /><br />Of the five cats that eat treats, four were right there begging for them. When I put the treat pieces down one wolfed it down right away, two sniffed them thoroughly then ate them, and the fourth walked away without eating it. I gave another piece to the fifth cat. After sniffing it, he ate the treat. I tried a second time and the same cat refused to eat the treat but the other three wolfed theirs down and tried to fight over the one that was left on the floor. They seem to be a big hit among the furry children.<br /><br />The first thing that I'm concerned about is the universal cat/dog treat. I was always under the impression that there is a reason why we have both cat and dog food. Both animals have different nutritional needs so they need to be fed separate foods. I'm a little leery of a product that is advertising as a meal for both animals.<br /><br />The Amazon Product page advertises these as a meal, treat, or food topper. The Nature's Variety website says that these are specifically treats. Please make sure you don't feed these as food. Also, make sure to adjust the food so you are not feeding too many calories to your pet.<br /><br />Finally, the box is huge, but the bag inside is small. It looks like there are only 16 biscuits in the bag. Having that in mind, you are paying almost eleven dollars (as of 8/3/12) for a box. To me, that is way too much to spend on treats.<br /><br />Over all, I do think they are a good treat for pets. There are a lot of healthy ingredients and are a big hit at my house. Honestly I will not be buying these anytime because of the cost of them.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Cat Lover<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.\",\n",
       " 'I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it\\'s organic. Real \"premium\" dog foods brag that they\\'ve no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real \"premium\" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it\\'s not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it\\'s cheap, but it\\'s not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real \"premium\" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don\\'t be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company\\'s 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back.',\n",
       " 'I was in a hurry as I shopped at my local pet food store late on a Saturday night.  My dogs needed dog food.  I buy a high quality dog food, it\\'s ingredients contain everything my vet wants me to be feeding me dogs. I also wanted to get them some special treats. But in my haste I picked up a bag of these \"gourmet\" chicken breast treats.  Usually I read the label on everything I give my dogs.  Not this time, they looked healthy and were very similar to other chicken breast treats I normally buy.  Had I carefully read the back of the bag I would have immediately returned them to the shelf and moved on.  The words on the back of the bag \"not for human consumption, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling this product\"-\"made in China\" would have tipped me off!!!  I never saw these warnings until after my beloved jack russell became very ill only mere hours after eating one of these treats.  My vet wanted to know what had she eaten that was different?  I handed him the bag-he looked it over in horror.  My dog developed an obstruction from the treat, which caused bloat because nothing could pass, salmonella and e-coli poisoning, and an infection in her heart giving her a 4/6 heart murmur.  She had to undergo expoloratory surgery, 7 sets of xrays, 2 ultrasounds, multiple blood tests,an ecg and we\\'re not done yet.  She is still in recovery, tests still pending.  This was one of the healthiest dogs my vet cared for before this incident.  Never had a health issue in the past, never a heart murmur.  At 9 years old most people thought she was 3 or 4.  I have been told the heart murmur has been caused by the infection settling in her heart, which is now irreversable.  Which means if she makes it through all of this her life expectancy just went from 16+ to 10 or 11.<br />My vet cultured one of the treats and could not believe what disease and bacteria it was loaded with.  I cannot believe I took such good care of her for 9 years and then put her through all of this suffering because I didn\\'t take the time to carefully look the product over. Thank you, Cadet and IMS Pet Products for contributing to my dog\\'s pain and suffering.',\n",
       " \"No...  I didn't try it myself and my dog loves eating it, but it smells like it has too much flavoring, seasoning and salt added. Smells like canned spam. Its mostly corn and mystery meats, but it has so much stuff added to make the dog like it that they become quite picky afterwards. This stuff is like human fast food. It's hard to feed them human grade dog food after they're given this stuff. Now, my dog spits out the all-natural kibble -which I assume he thinks tastes like cardboard after having his taste buds desensitized by all the salt. Kinda like a Pandora's box.<br /><br />The stool is softened soft serve ice cream consistency.

This just adds a nice portability to fresh dog food and I do mean it came fresh. I have bought this same brand at the store before and it was not fresh plus I paidd a higher price per can.

They have both since passed away but I continue to use this food. My 7 month old cat loves it as well as my 2 ferals I take care of. Yes it is pricey but greatr for cats with health problems. Cats do not need wheat or gluten. They need protein. Cat food or dog food should have chicken or fish as the fist ingredient not chicken meal or some by product.

I have eaten everything from the cheap presliced salami in the grocery store sandwich supplies to boars head to high-end, \"fresh\" artisan products. This is the worst thing I have tasted. Slim jims are better than this. It smells exactly like canned dog food and tastes exactly how I would expect canned dog food to taste, but saltier.

I enjoy these little Salami chubs as a little snack to tide me over til Dinner or whatever. Flavor wise it can be a bit salty.

Still, we had no idea that it was the food that was causing these problems.  Fortunately we found out that he had a wheat allergy and the primary ingredient in his food was wheat!  Poor dog..we were slowly killing him with his dog food.  After much research we purchased this food and he became well again.  His coat brightened up and his breath became tolerable again!  He lived a long and happy life until this past April when he passed on.  This past week we were graced with a shelter dog of about 8 or 9 years old.  We don\\'t know to much about him as he was \"dumped\" dog, but we know that he loves his Nutro Ultra Senior Dry Dog food!

       " 'This is a great dry dog food for seniors. In fact, my young dog prefers it to the Nutro Adult in the purple bag, this is so tasty. It has had a new face lift recently, new formulation, and they are even more crazy about it. The nuggets are a bit more plump and now multicolored and they do not look nearly as dry and crumbly. My dogs like it as much as ever and there has been no stomach upset from any change.<br />If you are looking for a high quality dog food that even many allergic dogs can eat, this is it. (My dog nearly died after eating one mouthful of Merrick Senior Medley, he got so sick. Other friends also report their dogs not being able to eat Merrick in wet or dry because of allergies.) If you are looking for a great senior food, this will keep your older pet looking slim and trim provided you follow the instructions on the bag. (As a side note, the canned food is also very good, but unfortunately, really not good value compared with the dry, and compared with other brands of canned, just as Natural Balance and Natural Balance Limited Ingredient.)<br />After the latest food recall, I also just want to remind people to always wash their hands before and after feeding their dog. It should be common sense but sadly it is not.  Salmonella abounds and while it will not usually harm a pet, it can harm humans. I love this food because it is so wholesome for my pets and so safe. 30lb bag is great value too.',\n",

Then they sell the dog food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  i would recommend going to [...] and compare brands and see what is right for you budget wise. try something like orijen or evo.\",\n",
       " \"I treat my animal's health as if it were my own and try to not only find the best veterinarian care, but also the best foods.  I've had my dog Brandy on Eagle brand dog food for many years.  I remember when there was the melanine scare, but I didn't have to worry because all of the ingredients were natural and were grown in the United States.  Aside from that, once I changed from an inexpensive food with suspect ingredients, there was a very noticeable difference in her general appearance, especially her fur.  It became sleek and ultra shiny and her body slim and trim.<br /><br />Brandy is now eleven years old and although I cannot credit Eagle for her health, she has had only one minor incident that she's had to be taken to the vet's for outside of regular checkups.  My veterinarian wholeheartedly approves of her diet and is pleased that even though she's getting to be an old girl, she's amazingly healthy.  I used to use another Eagle brand, but since she's getting older,  I switched to the senior brand.  She's getting a tad chunky, but her activity level has changed.  Brandy still is frisky and I do believe a good diet has a lot to do with it.<br /><br />When my vet called me the other day with some test results from another dog, I asked her about the corn in this food.  Everyone is yelling about corn being a poor and unhealthy filler so I couldn't resist asking.  She simply said that she considered corn a vegetable and had little bad to say about it.  In other words, a not to worry situation.

The two boys are diabetic and blind, but they HATED the Sciend Diet W/D food.  And frankly, I did too.  It was so expensive for, in my opinion, a much inferior product.  So now I feed my two boys a combination of this plus the Diamond Senior dry food, and they are doing great!  One of my girls has both a heart condition and allergies, as well as only a couple of teeth, and after a few weeks of feeding her this, the allergies have all but disappeared.  My other little girl was a former puppy mill mommy that we rescued, and clearly she had been neglected and abused.  She was in such bad shape that we had to remove all her teeth, one eye, and shave her whole body. For the last year and a half, we could count how many strands of fur she grew back. She also had food allergies.  But after being on this for a few months, her allergies are cleared up, and she's getting a soft, silky coat of fur - at long last.  I'm not saying this food is responsible for that or that it's a cure-all miracle, but to me it has been!  I've got a happy and healty (well, as healthy as they can be) pack, and I hope that Amazon continues to carry this food.<br /><br />HOWEVER, be advised:  they do not provide enough protection in the way they package the product when they ship it, so I end up with a few dented cans.  In my last order that I just opened today, 13 of the 24 cans were moderately or severely damaged, and I'm contacting Amazon about this because that is just unacceptable.  They need to use the air bags instead of paper filling, and that would solve the problem.  But the food, in my opinion, can't be beat!\",\n",

My dog is a chewer too and she never swallows anything whole, and I was watching her as she ate.<br />I had given her bully sticks, raw hide before (about once or twice a week), and she had no problems.<br />It couldn't have been anything else either because she hasn't eaten anything else other than her dog food (Ziwipeak) in the past 3 days. Ziwipeak isn't a kibble diet either. It is jerky like meat which is very soft. No signs of anything else (like plastic or metal toys, etc) on her x-ray either. So yes, it is these Chickenstrips.<br /><br />Anyhow, I took a new one out of the packaging, and attempted to cut it with a pair of scissors.<br />The strip was so hard my scissors wouldn't cut through, especially where the vein/tendon/muscle fiber (or whatever that is) is.<br />I probably will need a penknife or a small saw to do the job.<br /><br />So yea I learned my lesson, and should have listened to what another reviewer said earlier.<br />I took my chances because this product had so many 5 star feedback, and I made my dog go through unnecessary and avoidable pains and hardship. And also landed myself with a $1600 vet bill (sigh...)<br /><br />Definitely wouldn't advice this to anyone. If you have a really big dog like a Mastiff or a Pit Bull, I can see how this is probably OK because the dog itself is big, so this treat is really small compared in size. I have a 10 pound dog, so yea. I still wouldn't recommend anyone risking any chances, well unless you think a few thousand dollars in vet bills is nothing and don't mind your dog going through all that pain.<br />From now on if I am giving any chicken treats, its gonna be freezed dried or I will just boil or steam some boneless chicken myself.<br />Lesson learned.

       " 'I was in a hurry as I shopped at my local pet food store late on a Saturday night.  My dogs needed dog food.  I buy a high quality dog food, it\\'s ingredients contain everything my vet wants me to be feeding me dogs. I also wanted to get them some special treats. But in my haste I picked up a bag of these \"gourmet\" chicken breast treats.  Usually I read the label on everything I give my dogs.  Not this time, they looked healthy and were very similar to other chicken breast treats I normally buy.  Had I carefully read the back of the bag I would have immediately returned them to the shelf and moved on.  The words on the back of the bag \"not for human consumption, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling this product\"-\"made in China\" would have tipped me off!!!  I never saw these warnings until after my beloved jack russell became very ill only mere hours after eating one of these treats.  My vet wanted to know what had she eaten that was different?  I handed him the bag-he looked it over in horror.  My dog developed an obstruction from the treat, which caused bloat because nothing could pass, salmonella and e-coli poisoning, and an infection in her heart giving her a 4/6 heart murmur.  She had to undergo expoloratory surgery, 7 sets of xrays, 2 ultrasounds, multiple blood tests,an ecg and we\\'re not done yet.  She is still in recovery, tests still pending.  This was one of the healthiest dogs my vet cared for before this incident.  Never had a health issue in the past, never a heart murmur.  At 9 years old most people thought she was 3 or 4.  I have been told the heart murmur has been caused by the infection settling in her heart, which is now irreversable.  Which means if she makes it through all of this her life expectancy just went from 16+ to 10 or 11.<br />My vet cultured one of the treats and could not believe what disease and bacteria it was loaded with.  I cannot believe I took such good care of her for 9 years and then put her through all of this suffering because I didn\\'t take the time to carefully look the product over.

Even with tests from our vet, the process of finding her a good dog food that she could eat became a horrible trial and error process.

My dogs seemed to really enjoy the food and ate a lot of it, BUT... my boxer developed TERRIBLE smelling gas.  I mean, enough to clear the room.  Some nights I had to sleep in my daughter's room because it was so bad it would wake me up from a dead sleep.  My dachshund started to develop really bad breath, which can be common in small dogs as they get older, but her breath had no smell before being on this food.  My hound mix's hair started to thin and fall out around the base of her tail.  It just seemed too coincidental to start having problems with all three of my dogs after starting this food.<br /><br />So we switched back to Eukanuba Adult dog food after trying out the C&P Ultramix for about three or for months and ALL of the problems have disappeared.  Well, the dachshund's breath is still a little funny but NO WHERE near as bad as it was.  The boxer still has gas, but it is back to the point to where I only hear it... I don't smell it.  And my hound mix's hair looks good again.<br /><br />Do I think this food is terrible?  No, it seems to work for a lot of people and their dogs.  It just didn't work for us.  I wish it did.

That said, in terms of dog food, it's important to find a food made of fresh ingredients with no corn byproducts.<br /><br />My little guy eats a bowl of this per day and he has cured the constipation problem he was having before we switched foods.  He seems to really like the taste and to make it a little easier on his teeth, I add water to it to soften it.  That seems to do the trick since the kibbles are decent sized and might be a bit much for a smaller dog to take on.<br /><br />What's also nice about this is ordering through Amazon Prime and getting the heavy bag shipped for free to my door with two-day shipping.  This is by far the most reasonable price I've come across for a top-brand dog food.  Try a smaller bag to see if your pup takes to it and go from there.\",\n",

It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough.

I will update this review after a month to see if his wonderfully shiny coat remains like that & if he remains \"gas\" free. If so it will be a great find & tremendous saving. Unlike other dogs Boing did not experience the change of formula & so has not had the unfortunate stomach upsets. Another real plus was getting free shipping which helped with the overall cost. Due to health issues I have to be extremely careful of what he eats & as yet I have not seen any ill effects. Have given him the chicken grain free, this flavor & have 2 more to try. He isn\\'t a finicky eater which helps. More in a month or so - hope this helps anyone looking for a decent alternative to the usual big name dog foods.',\n",

It's also for all life stages, so I like that if this continues to work for her, I won't need to switch to a different food as she gets older.<br /><br />The ingredients in the food are great, and I especially like that there are pro-biotics.  Because the nutrients are so concentrated, I know that one of these 35 pound bags is going to last me a very long time with one growing puppy. At the same time, I had a difficult time getting her to eat the food (I guess it just didn't smell appealing to her).  I have had to mix it with a little pureed pumpkin and a tablespoon of the Canidae canned food of the same variety to make it a bit more appealing. At the same time, this could just have to do with my picky Lhasa-Shih's taste buds and not the food.  I know that several people who use the premium food are thrilled at the small amount of stool.  Personally, my puppy has still had larger stools at least twice a day (some of this could be from the Innova which she is being weaned off of).  Lhasa's are known for having sensitivities to allergens, and I love that this food is so gentle on her stomach.<br /><br />Mostly, I love that this is carried by Amazon and it can get to my house so quickly and easily.

She had a hard time eating the Mighty Dog because it is all chunked together like Spam. Even when I mashed it up, she had trouble eating it and scraping it out of her bowl.<br /><br />I started feeding her Pedigree Senior in the pouches. She likes it and where it had a little gravy in it it made it easier for her to eat. For the most part, it slides right out of the pouch although sometimes some of the food gets stuck in the little pocket at the bottom.<br /><br />One pouch a day is plenty for her. She loves it. We tried the new beef flavor with gravy and she actually likes it more than the Lamb and Rice but the beef flavor gives her diarhea really badly. She has never gotten diarhea from any other dog food so after I feed her the case I am switching back to this variety.<br /><br />This fills her up, is easy to eat, is quick and convenient for me to give her, and it seems to be really easy on her stomach.<br /><br />Highly recommend this for any small dogs.

Complaints dropped off in late 2009 and for most of 2010, FDA says, but the agency is once again seeing a rise in cases.<br /><br />The agency is advising consumers who feed their dogs chicken-jerky products to watch for these clinical signs:<br /><br />* decreased appetite,<br /><br />* decreased activity,<br /><br />* vomiting,<br /><br />* diarrhea (sometimes with blood),<br /><br />* increased water consumption,<br /><br />* and/or increased urination.<br /><br />If the dog shows any of these signs, FDA says pet owners should stop feeding the chicken-jerky product. Pet owners should also consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours, FDA says.<br /><br />Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some adverse event reports have involved mortality.<br /><br />FDA says it is working with several animal health diagnostic laboratories to determine why the products are causing illness. Despite extensive chemical and microbial testing, FDA adds it has not been able to identify a contaminant yet.<br /><br />FDA is also asking veterinarians to report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or Click here<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:I\\'ve been awarding this \"Chicken Breast, Flaxseed & Vitamins\" strip of chicken jerky to my 25 pound mixed breed dog for over a year without any problem.

That stuff is pure crap.<br /><br />We then went through a bag of Orijen, which I think is an excellent food, but not for her. She would eat it with toppings only and rarely ate all of it. Stools were often loose- not to mention the gas.<br /><br />A tiny dog can only eat about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of food per day so he/she needs to eat it all and it needs to be packed with nutrition. Back to the drawing board since the Orijen didn\\'t work!<br /><br />Next we tried the Wellness Super5Mix Adult Small Breed. She eats every bite and licks the dish and sometimes wants an evening snack of the plain Wellness kibble. She eats it without any topping but I do usually mix in a TBS of wet food (or cottage cheese) which Wellness recommends in order to give the dog a bit of extra fluid. We live in the desert, so that\\'s important. Anyway, she REALLY loves that! She has cleaned her plate twice daily ever since I started her on this wonderful food. The stools are formed and no gas.<br /><br />It seems to be the perfect food for her- and maybe for other dogs too which is why I am writing this. It is such a relief to see her eating a good nutritious dog food and enjoying it.<br /><br />I would definitely give it a try if your dog has \"pickyness\"/appetite/digestion issues, or if you just want to provide 4 star nutrition. It costs more than the grocery store stuff, but a small dog doesn\\'t eat much so I make it fit into my budget. I try to include it in with the occasional larger Amazon order and get  free shipping. It may be available in pet stores as well, but I have to go 15-20 miles out of town to find a pet store, so ordering online is easier.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying this food.',\n",
       " 'i have two yorkies, one weighs six pounds and the other weighs sixteen pounds.  i started them out on the puppy formula and then gradually onto the adult small breed.  the quality of the food is good and i like that the bits of kibble are small enough for my little dog, but hearty enough for my big boy.  my vet recommended dry kibble over wet dog food since it keeps their teeth cleaner which is important to me.  it may be more expensive than the brands available at the local grocery store or walmart, but my dogs are certainly worth it!!',\n",
       " \"I can't say enough good things about this food.  I have a ½ Pomeranian ½ Yorkie mix.  I don't feed Jake human food and his meals are measured according to his size.  As he matured into an adult he started to get blocky looking.  His stools were loose and he was constantly eating grass and even other animals fecies.  After much research on line I determined that though I thought I was giving him good dog food, I in fact was not.  I narrowed it down to this as being the food that I was going to switch him to.  The difference is like night and day.  He now has the shape that he should  Broad in the chest and narrow down through his belly and hind end.  He no longer eats grass or other fecies.  His coat is softer and his eyes do not water near as much.<br /><br />I highly recommend this food.  As an aside, Holistic bought Wellness.  Once I finish this bag of food I am going to switch Jake to Holistic, not because Wellness is not excellent but because Holistic is one step above and they now have Small Breed food.  It is important if you have a small dog that you feed them food specially for small breeds.  The little ones need more protein and fiber because of the energy that they expend.<br /><br />Switch your dog to this or Holistic and you will not regret it.  You will see a change in less than a week.\",\n",

We have tried so many different foods, including expensive grain free formulas, with no luck.  Even if we could get Bandit to eat, he was bored with each brand within a few weeks, or sometimes even within a few days.  I started to become very concerned that we weren't ever going to find a food that he would be happy with, and then we found Wellness Small Breed.  This is the only food he's accepted and consistently eaten!  He usually gobbles it right up, and his coat is soooo shiny!  The smaller kibble is perfect for his little mouth... I think part of the problem with other brands was the kibble size.  He seemed to actually tire of chewing the bigger pieces.  This formula has tiny pieces that he can easily crunch, and he finishes the whole bowl! :)<br /><br />We LOVE Wellness in our house... currently in the process of using up the remainder of another brand so we can switch our 8 yr old Miniature Schnauzer over to a Wellness formula too!\",\n",

I started my three little dogs cavapoo 15 lbs cavachon 12 lb yorkie 5 lbs on Wellness Core which is I'm sure a wonderful food but the protein is rated at 36% which turned out to be far to rich for my little dogs. After talking with the breeder of my yorkie she explained that too much protein in some breeds can be taxing on the liver and kidneys. I saw this in my dogs right away so I knew I had to make a quick change.  I definately wanted to eliminate the gas and copious amount of poop do to the protein content so I checked with the other foods made by Wellness and found that the simple five mix has a lot of the same wonderful ingredients as the Core but with a much more practical protein content for my dogs life style at 28%.  The results were amazing, immediately I saw a reduction in the amount of poop fewer times outside as well.  Everybody seems happier and life is easier with all three dogs on the same kibble.  I'm THRILLED.  Thank You WELLNESS.  I would strongly recommend this product.  One more side note...I really appreciate the promise made by Wellness on the front of the bag.

This entire time she has HATED her food, and I would have to get it wet in order for her to eat it. I was directed to dog food analysis dot com, and I believe this was a four or five star food, so I decided to give this food a try.<br />It finally arrived, and I gave my little Bailey a few pieces as treats, and she took them from me dry (a great sign). I then made her dinner and left the entire bowl dry, and she ate it, but what was interesting to me is at first she picked out the dry Artemis Fresh Mix and then came and looked at me as if to say \"more of THAT stuff please\"... so I wet the old food and she eventually ate it.<br />All in all I believe this will be a keeper, and I will update after she has been on it for a month or so.<br />Update:<br />We have officially finished the first bag of Artemis Fresh Mix. Since I have purchased the 15lb bag. There are a couple of differences since we switched over.<br />1. Bailey had THE WORST tear stains with the old food. They were so bad that when i used tear stain remover NOTHING happened... Since the switch her tear stains are down to a minimal, and I think it may be the tear stain from the prior food having to be wiped off, but I would not know for sure at this point.<br />2. Bailey finishes her food. She still mostly picks at it throughout the day, but she finishes ALL of her food by the end of the day.<br />3. Prior posters commented on less poop. I have to say we have had a complete opposite experience. This could be a result of the fact that she eats more, but it is hard to say. Also we still have mushy poop... I am not sure where this comes from. Since it has always been that way and she is completely healthy, I do not pay mind to this issue, nor does it deter me from continuing to purchase it.

This food has quality ingredients (see package) rather than filler.  Small bites:  good for small dogs.  My dog is highly allergic to beef, and has a reaction to many other foods I tried in her first year.  Finally, I realized I should just give her Artemis, which she liked and which I'd read about -- and that she didn't need other stuff mixed in (which inevitably upset her stomach).  My vet suggested I add a dropper-full of Grizzly Salmon Oil once a day (to help with her coat and allergies), so for her breakfast she gets a taste of salmon in her Artemis, plus a couple of tablespoons of water mixed in.  She loves it!  I'm highly satisfied.  I also give her a few bites of this dog food for her treats mid-day and at bed-time.  My understanding is that if you're going to introduce a new dog food into your dog's diet, you should do so gradually, so she'll get used to it (and so will her digestive track).  That's what I did, and it worked.  It's been four years now, and things are going well for her health and her diet.  Highly recommended.\",\n",

       " 'I wrote a REALLY long review regarding a different brand freeze dried dog food and now I\\'m wishing I hadn\\'t because it probably makes this product seem not as good in comparison and nothing could be further from the truth!<br /><br />When I originally read all of the reviews about this product I was a bit skeptical but VERY hopeful (despite the cost)since so many reviewers said that this was the one food that their totally-picky dog would actually eat.<br /><br />When I first tried giving her a nibble while out on a walk she turned her nose up at it like she does with all new things. I slowly started giving her some, mixed in with a clump of almond butter and her kibble. Eventually I got her to eat it and was happy to have something else to feed her along with the kibble and the other raw products I feed.<br /><br />(I know that raw is not supposed to be mixed with kibble, but in this case I am just trying to get her to eat anything) Anyway, I continued to do this until one day she just didn\\'t seem to want it. Finally it dawned on me that she probably JUST wanted this and nothing else and much to my surprise I was right!<br /><br />She likes it so much that she will eat it without the almond butter, which is a HUGE relief to me for it\\'s literally the FIRST and only food I\\'ve been able to skip the almondt butter with since she first stopped eating.<br /><br />She will get sick of it after a few days so of course I alternate what I feed her; before she had stopped eating completely I had her on a rotation diet which I believe is better for them anyway. The only downside, of course, is the cost, especially if you have a bigger dog like I do.<br /><br />It\\'s understandable, however, since the food is imported and air dried which I imagine takes longer. I love being able to feed my dog a raw diet without the GI upset she gets with fresh raw. I finally noticed that her feces is MUCH smaller when she is on a raw-only diet, and for a dog of 60+ lbs hers weren\\'t that big to begin with.<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I can\\'t say how AWESOME the ZiwiPeak company is! When I first noticed and wanted to try this product I emailed them asking if I could purchase a sample anywhere. Within days I received a package of the venison product in the mail. (Their \"trial size\" is a good size bag!) It wasn\\'t until after the fact that I saw that you CAN purchase that size through Amazon, and it retails for $8-$10!<br /><br />Even MORE impressive to me was a few months later when I wanted to try the lamb variety. I wasn\\'t able to find a similar trial size package of the lamb anywhere online, so I emailed them again and asked if the lamb variety was avaialble for purchase in anything smaller than the 2.2 lb bag.<br /><br />Once again within a few days I receive a package in the mail from them, and this time it included a large zip-lock baggie filled with the lamb variety and a scoop. Apparently they don\\'t make the small trial bags of the lamb but that didn\\'t stop them from sending me some! (which so far my dog seems to like!)<br /><br />To put this into perspective, I have emailed other raw manufacturers asking where I can purchase sample products from, including the other company I reviewed, and many of them never even answered me much less sent me anything!<br /><br />It definitely feels good to be feeding my dog something that I know she actually likes, plus feeding the benefits of a natural raw diet, PLUS a product that uses a drying process that hopefully preserves some of the natural enzymes of raw food.<br /><br />Can\\'t say enough good things about this food - if it was the ONLY food I fed my dog it wouldn\\'t be nearly as expensive to feed her but unfortunately because of her pickiness this isn\\'t the case.',\n",
       " \"My puppy has been on way too many dog foods: Orijen, Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and now ZiwiPeak. Out of the four, I'd say this is the best but also the most expensive. A 2.2lb bag lasts probably 3 weeks at most, but at least I know I'm feeding her raw without the mess of raw. It's not cheap but considering how much it costs for us to eat out per meal, $28/bag for 3 weeks really isn't much on the larger scheme of things. It also helps that she loves this stuff and gobbles it up and we know she's not getting any filler. For those who are concerned that the serving size in the back is too little, we had the same concern. But after giving her more than what was recommended, we noticed our puppy was not finishing her bowl of food each time which told us that she was already full and didn't even want more. So if you're used to feeding your dog kibble, the reason there's less to feed her is because there's no filler and it's just meat, meat and more meat so they fill up on it without having to process things like potato. I've also noticed that my dog sneezes and farts significantly less. She used to get eye stains but after we switched to Orijen and now ZiwiPeak, we noticed that her stains disappeared all together!<br /><br />Unless my puppy has any health or allergy issues to ZiwiPeak, I will never switch her to any other brand or type of food!\",\n",

Not only does she actually get excited about her meals, it has had marvelous effects on her digestion, even though she only gets this food about half the time.  Her stools are noticeably smaller and more solid (always a problem with her) and her usually bad flatulence is almost non-existent.

I was hesitant to spend fifty-five dollars on a bag of food when my two dogs go through almost three bags a month, but the two-day shipping made it seem worth it, particularly since the nearest PetCo (the only store in my area that seems to carry Natural Balance) is almost ten miles of slow-moving traffic away.  However, spending almost seventy dollars on a single bag of dog food is just too much, so I decided it was time to change brands.<br /><br />Luckily, my first choice turned out to be a success.  I swapped my dogs over to Taste of the Wild over the course of three or four days and their stool has remained solid, something that has always been an issue for my Boxer (with Natural Balance being one of the few premium brands that worked well for him).  Really, the only issue I have with Taste of the Wild is that the food smells a bit strong, but when the results are there it's hard to complain much about having to catch a nasty whiff of it a couple of times a day during feeding.  My dogs seem to love it, though, and are eating with a bit more enthusiasm than they did previously.<br /><br />As I said, the score was dropped one star for Amazon's handling of the product.  First, this product actually costs about four dollars more than it does in my nearby store (it is sold in a small, locally-owned dog bakery for $49), which is only a block away.  Second, for whatever reason Amazon does not offer two-day shipping via Prime for this item.  For me, this is the bigger issue, as I typically order a new bag right when I need it rather than stockpiling them.  With the unpredictable nature of standard shipping options, it's almost impossible for me to continue to order this product from Amazon.<br /><br />That said, you can't go wrong with this product if you have dogs with sensitive stomachs or allergies.  It's one of the better grain free foods that I've come across and works great for both of my large breeds (a Boxer and a German Shepherd).  Just check in your area and see if you can't find somewhere that sells it a bit cheaper.\",\n",

When I finally found the time to do some real research into the best dog food I was surprised to find that Innova dog food is not one of the ten best dog foods on the market.  Innova's top of the line food is their product line EVO, but was out of my price range.  I then identified the top dog foods from independent websites that rate dog food, and went through each until I found one that I could afford, without making any sacrifice in quality, and that was Taste of the Wild.  The variety of meats in this food is impressive, and what really put me over the top was that it contains fish meal so that our puppy will get the essential omega fatty acids that are absent from the vast majority of dog foods.<br /><br />To give our puppy a gradual transition we have been putting half Innova and half Taste of the Wild in his bowl, and he has been eating out all of the Taste of the Wild first, and coming back later to finish the Innova.  So we have been happy to know our puppy is getting one of the best dog foods on the market, we are saving $13 a month, and he likes it better.  The only issue we have had with Taste of the Wild is kind of gross to write about, but he has been defecating more and hasn't seemed as hungry at meal times. This was a small concern until we realized it was because the food is so tasty that he has been eating out of the bag whenever he wants to.

There are NO yucky \"meat by-products\"-- just meats and meat meals you can feel good about.  Unfortunately this food has a higher than normal fat and protein content. Very high protein (minimum 32% in this food) may not be a good choice for every dog (this is especially a concern for older dogs).  The fat percentage (minimum 18%) may great for working dogs and active dogs, but the average American couch potato dog could pack on pounds with that much fat unless you increase exercise and/or reduce your portion size (and that may lead to a dog who doesn\\'t feel full/stays hungry).<br /><br />If your dog is already overweight you would probably want a food with one-third the fat of this product.  If you decide to use this food I think it would be a good idea to monitor your dog\\'s weight carefully to avoid having weight gain sneak up on you and your best pal.  I am skeptical of dog foods which claim to be perfect for all life stages, too-- puppies and 15 year old dogs can survive on the same foods, but that doesn\\'t mean the same foods are ideal for each dog.<br /><br />You might want to compare this with similar high-quality holistic foods such as Blue Buffalo Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs. or Wellness Super5Mix Chicken Dry Dog Food (30-lb bag) (there are several great Wellness varieties) or Nutro Natural Choice Ultra Adult Dog Food- net wt. 35 lbs.

An easy way to tell is to look down at your dog while it is standing.  Viewed from overhead, you should see a definite \"waist\" narrowing in front of the back legs.  Another easy test is to feel the dog\\'s ribs.  You should be able to easily feel slight dips between the ribs-- if you can\\'t they are covered with a layer of fat (of course, prominent ribs mean your dog is too thin).',\n",
       " \"I have a French Bulldog that has developed food allergies and is also a very picky eater. In our quest to find him a food that was good for him and he actually liked eating I stumbled on Taste of the Wild at a local specialty dog food store. I decided to give TotW a chance after trying Canidae and realizing that the protein content was too high for my Frenchie.<br /><br />After switching to Taste of the Wild I immediately noticed an improvement in my pups stool - nice and firm and only 2-3 movements per day. Vice 5+ movements on Nutro and Canidae. My Frenchie's notorious gas was also cut way down. I supplement his dog food with all-natural unflavored yogurt too and this helps cut down on the gas greatly. After a few weeks I also noted that my dog's coat is soft and shines.<br /><br />Another positive to Taste of the Wild is that their formulas are similar enough between Hi Prairie, Pacific Stream and Wetlands Canine that I can rotate the menu a bit and keep my pup happily chomping down on his food. Previously my dog would tire of the same dog food after only a few weeks.<br /><br />For anyone with a dog with food allergies I highly recommend Taste of the Wild. Not only are their formulas grain free, but they also use unique sources of protein. For example duck instead of the more readily available chicken as a major protein source.\",\n",

I have a 9 year old chocolate and 5 year old black lab. The 9 year old has chronically had an incredibly dull coat and an energy level that is increasingly low. I know, he\\'s no spring chicken, but he was beginning to look far older than he really is. The 5 year old has always been very active with a fairly shiny coat. We switched them over slowly, as everything I read said to do & within a week it was easy to see that the older dog\\'s coat was shinier especially around his face. A month in & completely switched over to this food, the chocolate\\'s coat is shiny, smooth, and soooo much softer than he has ever been since he was a puppy. The black lab is even shinier than he was before. Their eyes are brighter and even the old guy seems to have more energy. The switch was easy for us, we live very rural and I have dogs who drag home dead animals and will eat pretty much anything, so no issues there. I noticed around about week 3 they were getting chubby and so we have cut back the amount we feed to what seems about right. Definitely feeding less than we did before & I think less \"deposits\" to be picked up in the back yard!<br /><br />We are so happy we made the change to a grain free food for our boys.

So we ordered him a big bag of Taste of the Wild, a company I\\'m already familiar with through their cat food line. For the week or so he\\'s been eating it, I can already see a noticeable improvement in his hunger alone--he used to gingerly pick up pieces of Pedigree kibble and crunch them down as if saying \"Meh, it\\'s food, Kind of.\" After the second or so bowl of TOTW, he flies face first into his bowl like a heat-seeking missile, and scarfs down his reward so quickly you\\'d think he hadn\\'t eaten for days! The ingredient list is pretty top notch--the first three ingredients are bison, lamb meal, and venison, which is a ridiculously great indulgence considering the stuff that passes for dog food these days. (Now, if they could only get a similar meat profile for their cat food, and cut down on the sweet potato...but that is another review.)<br /><br />Two things to note, though: this food is rich, with a much higher level of protein and fat than your dog may be used to.

I recommend you do the same, especially if your dog is transitioning off of a heavy corn/filler-based food. From what I\\'ve read about the fat, it\\'s good for both your dog\\'s coat conditions and energy levels, but if you have a little couch potato dog who doesn\\'t mind not running for days on end, I might urge you to consider something a little less extreme. But for big, strong and active dogs, this food\\'s definitely a winner. It\\'s a touch pricey, but 30 lbs of food for one 20+ lb dog? I\\'d say it works out pretty well, at least in this household.',\n",
       " \"Many dry grain free foods are good but few give great bang for your buck. Taste of the Wild certainly does. It ranks among the highest rated grain free dry dog food in the market and the price can't be beat. My lab loves it, and the kibbles are ideal for snack/treat size as well. I used to buy treats for training but these kibbles to the job... thus saving me more money. The 30lbs bag is work the purchase. I highly recommend it.\",\n",
       " 'I fed this, for the longest time (almost a year, cycling with \"Wetlands\" variety) to my English Bull pup. She appeared to enjoy it, presumably because it\\'s a very rich food - multiple high-lean protein sources, unique protein, good fat content, grain free and at the low end of the premium food price line ($48 / 30 lbs @ my local shops).<br /><br />She grew quickly, her coat is always shiny and smooth, her eyes bright, incredible energy for an Eng-Bull and she never had any bathrooming or vomiting issues. Stellar grub for her.<br /><br />Now to the unless:<br /><br />I still give this food 5-stars because my scenario is comparitively unique. I\\'d gotten a 2nd pup (Treeing Tennessee Brindle - like a Plott Hound, only smaller). Immediately began transitioning her from her crap-food (Purina Puppy Chow) to ToTW. She liked ToTW as much as my Eng-Bull but about the 3 week mark began developing a bad case of Pyoderma (puss filled sores, akin to hives) on her belly, neck and where her joints meet the body. My first suspect as it should be with anybody was a protein - what does ToTW Praire and Wetlands have in common? Chicken and egg product.<br /><br />Thus began the transition to \"Pac. Stream\" who\\'s sole source of protein is fish meal... guess what - the pyoderma worsened. Her belly was redder than a fire-hydrant, countless numbers of pustules, balding from all the itching she was going through and incredibly destructive behavior (I have a 16 item list of all the stuff she\\'s eaten - includes digging a hole in the couch, a cell phone, dozens of poo-bags - in my absence and I\\'m pretty sure it wasn\\'t due to separation anxiety).<br /><br />Next step, check ingredients and what do ToTW \"Prarie\", \"Wetlands\" and \"Pac. Stream\" ALL have - that\\'s right: Fish meal. Now, between Cefpodoxime (a wide spectrum antibiotic), some strong prescription shampoo and the removal of all fish proteins from her diet she\\'s looking good and behaving better.<br /><br />Thus, this is a great dog food..... unless you\\'ve got a pup w/ fish allergies (you could still reasonably feed the \"Sierra\" blend but none of the other three).<br /><br />As a side-note, if you do have a pup w/ what you expect to be food allergies try Natural Balance LID (Limited Ingredient Diet) blends. Both of mine now eat NB LID Venision / Sweet Potato w/ canned supplements that don\\'t have any fish protein or oils in them (Merrick has a great line of canned food sans fish product).<br /><br />- MD.',\n",

       " \"I have 4 Pomeranians. I switch to TOTW because my dogs are getting old and I want them to have better food so they can live longer. I have switch for over an year. At first I didn't notice any difference on them. My husband was laughing at me saying all I know is spending money on nothing and I should quit my online shopping habit. So he insisted that we should just buy regular and cheap dog food from Walmart. So we did and that's when we've noticed the difference. The dog food we got from Walmart was only half the price of TOTW. However, with the same weight of food it lasts shorter because my dogs need to eat more to satisfy their stomachs. Just like we all like junk food and the more we eat the more we want. Eventually, I spent the same money on dog food in a month and they've all pack on weight. So now my husband said we should switch back to TOTW and he admits that it is a good product.\",\n",
       " \"This is, in my opinion, some of the best dog food out there. It is a reasonably priced grain-free food, which you usually have to pay well over $50 to find it's equal. Especially when you look at poor quality food like Science Diet that is usually sold at a ridiculous price. I have two young Carolina Dogs which, due to their feral breed, are extremely picky. We tried a variety of foods, including Blue Buffalo that they would not deem to touch. The only way we could get them to eat it was to mix tasty things in with it after they dropped too much weight from not eating. So we switched to this, which I thought might appeal to them with the gamey meat and high protein. Bingo. We have been giving this to them for several months now and they continue to wolf it down, with or without tasty things mixed in. Love it.\",\n",
       " 'This is a fantastic dog food, by far the best I\\'ve ever used.  I switched my English Springer Spaniel to it when he was about 10 months and it solved all kinds of dietary problems he was having.  I had started him out as a puppy on Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover\\'s Soul.  It was great food and he seemed to do well on it.  His waste was \"hard\" and regular and everything was fine.  When he got a little older and I switched him to the adult version of Chicken Soup, he started have frequent problems with diarrhea.  And it didn\\'t go away.  At first I thought it was the adjustment period.  Then it lasted for well over a month.  I finished the bag and put him on Taste of the Wild.  It completely solved the problem.<br /><br />The best part is that he absolutely goes nuts over this stuff.  Before, with the Chicken Soup, he would eat -- slooooooowly.  It was like he was hungry but didn\\'t really find it appetizing.  It was a real pain because we would have to watch him eat so our little poodle wouldn\\'t steal his food.  With Taste of the Wild, he goes nuts, jumps and spins circles, and then wolfs down the whole bowl in about 90 seconds.  I quit buying doggy treats for his training exercises because he loves his food even more!  I\\'m not kidding.  In fact, I think the quality taste of this product is what sets it apart from some other high-end brands.  My dad gives Fromm to his old lab and has the same problem about him eating it slowly and without much enthusiasm.  He\\'s thinking of trying this stuff just to make the dog eat faster.<br /><br />When I was originally shopping for this product, I noticed a few people commented about the smell.  They said it stinks.  Well, I disagree.  It honestly smells like a roast dinner in the crockpot with a hint of that dog-food smell.  My wife agrees (but happens to dislike the smell of roast dinners).<br /><br />One last thing is that Taste of the Wild seems to give you a lot of bang for the buck.  I takes less food to achieve the same results as cheaper foods, probably because the nutrients are so high.  I feed my one year old, 50 pound English Springer about two cups a day and he stays the perfect weight.  That ration makes the bag last about 6 weeks.  Not bad at all.',\n",
       " 'TOTW is one of the highest quality dog foods you can get.  I\\'ve been through many brands of \"top quality\" dog foods only to find irregular stools, low energy levels, and supplementing both of my dogs diets with vitamins, vegetables, or other items.  After my third round of research I decided to give TOTW a try, something that I can\\'t even get a 30lb bag of in my local pet food stores.<br /><br />Both of my pitbulls love this food!  They drool for it while I\\'m fixing up a few bowls for them, and they haven\\'t done that in the past.  One of them has an extremely sensitive stomach but was fine with the switch over as I followed the switching schedule on the back of the bag.<br /><br />I will say, after the dogs were on the 3rd day of TOTW one of my pitbulls start to show signs of detoxification.  She got rashy, her skin was hot to the touch, and she seemed miserable.  We debated stopping the switch of the food, but are glad we didn\\'t.  After a few days of this she was fine, and her coat was looking better, her stools consistent and healthy, and her mood greatly improved.<br /><br />Our other pup had a very difficult time putting on weight since we had to heavily treat him for mange for over 8 months.  As some reviews have mentioned this dog food has quite sufficient protein and fat content, which helped him get back up to his normal weight as well as keep his coat looking shinny and soft.  The fat content shouldn\\'t be an issue if you are keeping your dogs active as you should be!<br /><br />Bottom line: This food is extremely high quality, has great immune system benefits for your pup, is grain free (dogs shouldn\\'t eat grain!), and will boost your dogs energy.  This is the closet thing you can feed your pup to a raw diet, without having to deal with raw food, and dogs love it!  Please, stop feeding your dog the major brands of dog food that will put your dog in the Vet\\'s office.  Spending a little more on dog food will lower your vet visits and your dog will be healthier and happier after this switch!',\n",

Nine months ago I switched her food from IAMS Healthy Natural dog food to Taste of the Wild and I couldn't be happier with the results. Her coat improved in its shine and texture, her energy level improved and she became slightly leaner. She enjoys the taste of her food and I have been able to free feed her without her putting on excess weight. I highly recommend this brand of dog food.\",\n",

We took him to the vet and got a full blood panel done and nothing of interest came back - which meant it had to be something he was eating.  Long story short - I did a ton of research and found that our dog needed to get grains out of his diet.  We bought Taste of The Wild - Bison and Venison formula and almost immediately noticed a difference.  We are 2 weeks into this new food and when I tell you - he is 100 percent better.  He has not had a bout of digestive distress since he has been on this food.  I am so happy to have found a food that works so well.  If your dog has digestive issues consider changing to this outstanding grain free dog food - I hope this review helps.',\n",

       " \"When I got my Goldendoodle from the breeder, he was eating Iams dog food so we kept him on it.  He got very sick with a yeast infection in his ears and on his skin.  I started cooking organic food for him but he didn't get any better and developed a UTI by the time he was three months old.  He was super skinny and his hair was falling out and thinning.  After taking him to the vet for treatment, I decided to put him on TOTW.  He loved it from the start.  He is now six months old and the size of a small horse, which is what a standard Goldendoodle should be!  He has a beautiful coat and no longer has stinky ears.  We can't take him out in public without people stopping us to pet him or ask about him.  The difference that TOTW made in a matter of two weeks is unbelievable.  I wouldn't feed him anything else now.  It is worth every penny.  He loves the Salmon and Bison/Venison flavors.  He doesn't care for the other flavors.\",\n",
       " \"This food is great. I have two dogs, a golden retriever and a Shih Tzu Brussels Griffon mix and they both love it. My Brussels was a 1 year old rescue dog and he wouldn't eat the Iams dog food we had so I researched food and found this one. I decided to give it a try. My golden went blind less then a year ago and gained a lot of weight(it's one of the side effects of his disease SARDS) so I wanted to see if this would help at all.... Well guess what! My golden has lost weight and his coat looks healthier after 1 month 1/2 of eating the food and my Brussels loves it too. I highly recommend this food! On a side note we watched my in-laws 14 year old dog and she hardly eats her wet pedigree dog food. She pushes it around a lot, so I gave her a few pieces of the taste of the wild to see what she would do and guess what she ate it all then barked at me for more!\",\n",

Searching the web we found this dog food, rated as one of the tops for several specialized websites and blogs, one of the more affordable of the listed top brands and after reviewing Amazon's comments, we decided to try.<br /><br />My dog looooves this food, she's being doing great since, more energy, a healthy looking and it helped heal her disease. Thanks god that a local supermarket began to bring this brand because since I live outside US, shipping made it a lot more expensive, but totally worthy.<br /><br />I truly recommend this dog food.. Fiona loves it and we've been feeding her with this for about six month and still not bored of it. Right now, shes eating her food like the first time and leave a clean plate every time... not even in the floor I found a single piece.<br /><br />This supplier is extremely quick so you won't have any delayed issues... this was specially important for me since I live outside US.<br /><br />Hope this review is useful since we found a treasure in this brand.\",\n",

       " 'I have a pack of German Shepherd Dogs from European bloodlines - three generations live in our household. Two of our dogs are quickly becoming seniors (in a few months they will both be in double digit years) and our only female is highly allergic to something - at odd intervals she will lose all the fur on her back, or all her fur on her belly, or all her fur on her legs.  She isn\\'t normally a picky eater as she has a high food drive but this last round of furlessness has really knocked her for a loop. We had been feeding various Diamond formulas, something has happened as recently they have had serious gas attacks - worse than a sewer pit. It has become intolerable indoors :-(<br /><br />I\\'ve been eying Taste of the Wild - Bison formula for years, but the price of the bags has kept me at bay. Having fed Solid Gold in the past I am aware of the fact grainfree foods without fillers means feeding less food per day which equates to helping to normalize the price and hence means less land mine materials to dispose of... but it\\'s still hard to shake the price at first, especially in this economy.  When feeding Diamond we typically also add a powder multi-vitamin mineral formula as well as omega 3 oils and I give them glucosamine and chonditrin, all of which appears to be in Taste of the Wild - Bison formula which means it will also help to normalize the price a bit and save us time.<br /><br />I am very impressed with the list of ingredients and the lack of cereal / grain fillers.  The bag lists 5 strains of probiotics as well as raspberries, blueberries, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, yucca - for less smelly stools!, a plethora of vitamins and minerals as well as essential fatty acids including omega 3s.<br /><br />This evening I brought home 30 pound bags of each the Bison and the Salmon formulas.  The senior dogs quickly turned a keen interest to the new bags - they largely ignore the Diamond bags.  I gave them each 1 cup this evening - at first they were hesitant but I added a few bites from our dinner to entice them to their food bowls - they quickly discovered the new food tastes great!  I purchased TOTW locally at a farmer\\'s supply where I also paid sales tax.  Currently the dog food is less expensive here on Amazon AND without sales tax, to boot. I also like the fact I can order the food online - my husband won\\'t have to go pick up the food when I am out of town.  If the dogs do well to this formula it really will be a win-win-win-win situation as it will likely save some expensive veterinary bills as it improves the health of our dogs. There\\'s no way to put a price on good health!<br /><br />UPDATE: In just a few short days the gas attacks have ceased, the dogs are begging for TOTW over Diamond and we have noticed a reduction in doggie smell.  Even my frugal husband has agreed these are all worthwhile benefits to justify the increased cost.<br /><br />In our ideal world, our dogs coats and health seem to be the best when we combine TOTW with the vitamin and mineral supplement <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A6XJGG\">Farnam Super 14 6.5LB</a> along with the Omega 3 supplement <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q9KPRG\">AniMed CoMega Supreme 128 oz</a>. I also add <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AMUWLK\">Liqumins ConcenTrace Trace Mineral Drops, Low Sodium, 8-Ounce Bottle</a> to their drinking water.  The foul doggie odor is minimalized; shedding is a minimum; bowel movements are regular - not too firm, not too soft; and their coats, their teeth, their eyes.. all aspects indicate happy healthy dogs :-)',\n",

       " \"I have a lab puppy who believes there's nothing better in life than to make her dog food vanish in record time before throwing it up.  This has inspired my older yellow lab to follow suit as if they are training for the pie eating contest at next year's county fair.  After spending too much of my time trying to decide on which dog food bowl is best between the plastic apparati with stalagmites growing out of the bottom, I came across this good looking and reasonably priced stainless bowl, which according to pet experts avoids some problems associated with bacteria and plastic.  Plus, I was afraid of the other bowls due to some of the durability issues a few posters had mentioned.  So, I opted for this meathod, seeing it was close to what I have been doing, which is inserting a bowl upside down in their bowls, forcing my dogs to eat from the edges, which does slow them down a little bit.<br /><br />The first meal with these bowls went rather well.  It took them a few moments to get used to the central buldge, and did force them to move around, where I actually did hear some chewing (which was a first in a few months).  The next few meals seemed to get faster and faster, to where it may slow them down some, but after hearing the pupply belching and looking around for more food with her new and improved speed eating technique, I'm not terribly convinced I made the correct investment.  I've gone back to placing a smaller bowl upside down, which still provides the greatest slowdown meathod.  And yes, I've tried one and two tennis balls, small and big bowls and aside from giving them one morsel at a time, I'll stick with the upside down bowl, or I may try a muffin sheet a few clever posters have suggested.<br /><br />This bowl is not a total loss, and for dog owners with breeds sporting a flatter mug and even for some cats, this might work.  I may have to try my luck on one of the better made plastic Tom Sawyer Cave looking jobs, but for now, the bowl inside a bowl works best for me, and the durapet bowl will be used to help them slow their water gulping a little.\",\n",

       " \"I saw a clip about dehydrated dog food in my email from a holistic vet site.  It was explained that dehydrated was a good go between when switching a dog from regular unhealthy processed food to a raw diet.  I decided to try it.  I bought the trial 4 oz. box.  In the past, my dog has been the pickiest eater there is.  He will only eat one brand of food...and believe me I have tried them all.  When I feed him, the food sits in the bowl and he nibbles.  It takes an entire day for him to eat one cup of food.  I removed his food bowl last night and didn't feed him.  I figured I would let him get good an hungry.  This morning, I measured out 1/2 cup of Thrive and heated up 1/2 cup of water.  When I mixed it, it looked like soup.  After I let it re-hydrate it looked even worse.  I figured he would never eat it.  I set it down and he ATE THE WHOLE BOWL in one sitting.  Maxx LOVES it.  I just ordered a 10 lb. box.  Thank you Honest Kitchen for giving me a healthy food to feed my best friend that he really enjoyed.\",\n",

       " \"All three of my dogs LOVE this food -- even my ultra-finicky dog! It is human-grade food and full of every good thing. It is very, very easy to make, and meal-time has become a big deal in my house -- they all sit with wagging tails as I prepare it. When I stayed at my mom's house for a couple weeks, her two dogs were much more interested in having my dogs' food than their own regular dog food. I originally bought this food because I wanted to put my dogs on a vegan diet. For the protein source, I use tofu and all sorts of beans like chickpeas/garbanzo beans, black beans, etc. They love it no matter what I add to it. I rotate the type of oil I use, or sometimes I use a blend. When I first put them on this food, I used the serving size they recommend, and my dogs started gaining weight. So I am actually able to use less than what they say in the instructions. I have three 50-pound dogs and I use approximately 1 scoop per dog, twice a day. In the 10-lb bag there are about 198 scoops, in the 5 lb bag there are around 99 scoops, in the 20 oz bag there are around 24 scoops. So from that you should be able to calculate a good estimate of the cost for your dog(s). Of course for smaller dogs you can use less. With my finicky dog, I used to have to stand over him and goad him into eating his commercial dog food (which even contained meat). Now he scarfs his food every time! One other note: I sometimes add some Nature's Recipe Vegetarian formula dry dog food just to add some crunch. For vegetarian/vegan treats, I feed them Sam's Yams and C.E.T. VeggieDent. It is a wonderful thing to be able to give my dogs a cruelty-free diet! And we never have to worry about all those crazy dog food recalls!\",\n",

       " \"I purchased seven (7) varieties of the Organix organic dog food from my local whole foods market for $2.79-2.99 plus $2.31 tax = $37.79--12-12.7 oz cans.<br /><br />There are two types of Organix organic dog food grain-free, and those that have grain products such as flaxseed meal.<br /><br />My two ShihTzus Darby and Hampshire prefer turkey and chicken over beef and lamb so I purchased the following formulas:  chicken & vegetable; turkey, carrot & potato; chicken & organic brown rice; turkey & vegetable, chicken & brown rice; turkey vegetable; turkey & vegetable (grain-free); and chicken & vegetable (grain-free).<br /><br />Darby and Hampshire's typical diet is roast chicken with brown rice and mix vegetables.<br /><br />Their snacks normally consist of non-nitrate hot dogs, pan fried chicken livers, butter fried sweet potatoes or mashed sweet potatoes, turkey meatballs, cheese wedges, Bullies, Merrick sesame sticks, 2-TBS of Haagen-Daz vanilla or butter pecan ice cream, and the occasional non-nitrate cold cut.<br /><br />After tropical storm Debbie swept through Central Florida, I knew I needed to find a nonperishable dog food to stock for the hurricane season in preparation for power outages.<br /><br />I had searched for years for a high quality nontoxic and reasonably priced dog food that Darby and Hampshire would actually eat.  The Organix organic dog food was a hit.  When they see the cans they stand up and take notice.<br /><br />When I opened the can, I could clearly see the difference in quality, and I could certainly smell the difference.  A can of Organix organic dog food is 95% organic, and made is the USA!<br /><br />A typical can contains 7.5% crude protein, 6% crude fat, 1% crude fiber, and 78% moisture.  The feeding recommendations are 3/4 to 1 1/4 per 15 lbs. body weight per day.  The dog food also contains several vitamins (Vitamin E, A, B12, & D3)and minerals.<br /><br />Several of the varities contain organic garlic and thiamine mononitrate which is a synthetic form of vitamin B1.<br /><br />I am so very pleased with this find.  After 4 years, and many bad purchases I've finally found the right food for Darby and Hampshire.  What an awesome dog food.  It really smells and looks like human grade food.<br /><br />I also purchased the Organix dry dog food but Hampshire and Darby both had a week of uncontrollable diareau, and Darby was also vomiting.  I returned the Organix dry food to the store, and they gave me a full refund.<br /><br />The Organix dry dog food made their feces very dark and running and the stains were more difficult than normal to remove.  Darby is 4.6 years and Hampshire is 3.11 years.\",\n",

It's hard to feed them human grade dog food after they're given this stuff.

Before I could avoid him he had already asked me what dog food we currently used. I told him, and he immediately asked me if we were having any skin issues.

Part of what I look for in a dog food is the amount of protein, the front of the package calls this a daily treat, but they have 61% protein and I am just not sure that my dog needs that much extra protein every day.  I think this is more likely a weekly treat.<br /><br />These are better than the regular rawhide bones because it is a treat with a smaller amount of rawhide, and better than the crunchy bones because it did not fall apart and leave little pieces everywhere.

Translation = WAY more poop to pick up. Then there is the mid-grade dog food, like Nutrisource, that contains fewer fillers. That means the dog eats less, poops less, and is getting better nutrition from his food. I checked the labels of probably 15 different foods and this nutrisource brand looked like it had the best value. Yes, it\\'s more expensive than your lower quality stuff, but the dog will also eat less of it. When my dog was on purina, he was eating about 3.5 cups a day. Since switching to nutrisource, he eats about 2.5 cups. So in the end, this better quality food is not a whole lot more expensive. I know it\\'s unplesant to think about, but I should mention that since switching to nutrisouce, my dog farts a lot less and his poop stinks a lot less too, a very nice bonus for the responsible dog owner who needs to pick it all up.<br /><br />I would recommend this food for any large breed dog.

Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.

If you have a really big dog like a Mastiff or a Pit Bull, I can see how this is probably OK because the dog itself is big, so this treat is really small compared in size.

I still wouldn't recommend anyone risking any chances, well unless you think a few thousand dollars in vet bills is nothing and don't mind your dog going through all that pain.<br />From now on if I am giving any chicken treats, its gonna be freezed dried or I will just boil or steam some boneless chicken myself.<br />Lesson learned.

       " 'When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my \"baby\" each day.<br /><br />Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br /><br />I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br /><br />At first that sounds good to you, doesnt\\' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman\\'s Own, it was what lead me to find Newman\\'s Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what\\'s wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker\\'s food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren\\'t supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br /><br />Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br /><br />The reason why Newman\\'s Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br /><br />Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br /><br />Better yet, Newmans\\' own uses organic.<br /><br />I\\'ll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog\\'s food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that\\'s organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br /><br />Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman\\'s Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br /><br />(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman\\'s Own has changed all this!)<br /><br />So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it\\'s thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it\\'s organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman\\'s Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br /><br />Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it\\'s cheapest...<br /><br />if you look at the nutritional info on Newman\\'s own, even if you don\\'t care that it\\'s human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br /><br />So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman\\'s Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn\\'s book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He\\'s studied this far more than I\\'ll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br /><br />He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn\\'t have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren\\'t outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br /><br />I, personally, have helped friends CURE \"health\" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept \"treating\" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and \"cured\" them!<br /><br />Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can\\'t cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.<br /><br />and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it.',\n",

The replacement food is great.<br /><br />Here\\'s my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution:<br /><br />I have been buying the \"Organic Liver for Dogs\" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Amazon. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product.<br /><br />I wasn\\'t even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Amazon are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets.<br /><br />As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman\\'s Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon doesn\\'t allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I\\'m afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally).<br /><br />UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me.<br /><br />I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars.<br />I give the customer service from Newman\\'s Own Organics a 5 star rating as well.<br />I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars.<br />Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I\\'ll round up to 5 stars.',\n",

Bottom line, we were feeding her, but our vet compared it to us eating spaghettios every day for every meal for life.<br /><br />Demodex is not contagious but inherited and a skin disorder we had to treat.  We talked to our vet about her immune system and how we would want to keep her as healthy as possible during treatment and after.  While he didn't really recommend any particular brand, he did encourage us to educate ourselves about what's out there.<br /><br />After some research and with the idea that we buy Newman's Own brand foods for our human selves, we ordered the dry kibble and mixed it with the active dog and puppy formula canned food they make as well.  Our dog does love this food, and clearly prefers the canned to the her old cheap foil top square packages we'd pick up each grocery visit.  We have noticed that her fur, while always been soft, has become thick and buttery soft when you pet her.<br /><br />I know the vet warned us that the treatment might have adverse effects, but she has been fine.

       " 'When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my \"baby\" each day.<br /><br />Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br /><br />I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br /><br />At first that sounds good to you, doesnt\\' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman\\'s Own, it was what lead me to find Newman\\'s Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what\\'s wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker\\'s food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren\\'t supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br /><br />Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br /><br />The reason why Newman\\'s Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br /><br />Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br /><br />Better yet, Newmans\\' own uses organic.<br /><br />I\\'ll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog\\'s food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that\\'s organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br /><br />Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman\\'s Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br /><br />(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman\\'s Own has changed all this!)<br /><br />So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it\\'s thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it\\'s organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman\\'s Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br /><br />Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it\\'s cheapest...<br /><br />if you look at the nutritional info on Newman\\'s own, even if you don\\'t care that it\\'s human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br /><br />So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman\\'s Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn\\'s book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He\\'s studied this far more than I\\'ll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br /><br />He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn\\'t have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren\\'t outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br /><br />I, personally, have helped friends CURE \"health\" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept \"treating\" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and \"cured\" them!<br /><br />Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can\\'t cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.<br /><br />and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it.',\n",

Everything is good. The replacement food is great.<br /><br />Here\\'s my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution:<br /><br />I have been buying the \"Organic Liver for Dogs\" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Amazon. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product.<br /><br />I wasn\\'t even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Amazon are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets.<br /><br />As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman\\'s Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon doesn\\'t allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I\\'m afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally).<br /><br />UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me.<br /><br />I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars.<br />I give the customer service from Newman\\'s Own Organics a 5 star rating as well.<br />I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars.<br />Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I\\'ll round up to 5 stars.',\n",

Interesting to look back at the reviews here and see three from the April - May timeframe that sound like there may have been similar issues for others around the same time we made our purchase.

       " \"I have two Yorkies that are very picky eaters.  After a period of 2-3 days up to 2-3 weeks they will decide they don't like the food I am giving them and just stop eating.  I went through a real struggle when one of them got a stomach bug and got real sick with vomiting and diarrhea.  I started cooking fresh turkey with brown rice and his stomach healed up in no time.  But them I couldn't get them back onto dog food!!  I found the Newman's Organic Turkey and Brown Rice formula and they LOVE it.  I still give them a good quality dry food for little snack times.  However, they usually wait for their turkey and rice and gobble it up.  They have lots of energy and for the last two months have not gotten tired of the food.  I think we have found a keeper!\",\n",
       " \"I do think this is a good food.  However, it is just too mushy to serve alone.  I give the feline version to my cats and they love it, but cats don't mind a softer food.  We give our little poodle canned food for the low carbs and since our cats love Newmans we thought we would try it for him.  First I got it in the big cans, which is enough for 2 days for Joey and I was OK with that.  The first can I used was OK, not great, but OK when I opened the can and gave him the top 3 ounces.  His dinner with the second 3 ounces wasn't as good.  Next day it was even mushier in the second half of the can.  I liked the food though and he did well on it so I ordered the smaller cans to see if there would be a difference there.  I used half of a can this morning for his breakfast and it was OK, but not stiff enough to make it easy for me to chop up and him to eat.  I am going to use this food as a mixer with his Tiki dog food until it is used up and then I don't think I will buy it again.  I don't get it either because it is the same 78% moisture as his California Natural and By Nature dog food but it just doesn't hold up.  I will continue to give it to my cats in their rotation, but little Joey will be sticking to his other good foods.\",\n",

A couple months went by, wouldn't say our dog didn't like her cheap dog food, but she did develop demodex and a whole new world about dogs and health opened up to us.  Bottom line, we were feeding her, but our vet compared it to us eating spaghettios every day for every meal for life.<br /><br />Demodex is not contagious but inherited and a skin disorder we had to treat.  We talked to our vet about her immune system and how we would want to keep her as healthy as possible during treatment and after.  While he didn't really recommend any particular brand, he did encourage us to educate ourselves about what's out there.<br /><br />After some research and with the idea that we buy Newman's Own brand foods for our human selves, we ordered the dry kibble and mixed it with the active dog and puppy formula canned food they make as well.  Our dog does love this food, and clearly prefers the canned to the her old cheap foil top square packages we'd pick up each grocery visit.  We have noticed that her fur, while always been soft, has become thick and buttery soft when you pet her.<br /><br />I know the vet warned us that the treatment might have adverse effects, but she has been fine.  I credit a healthier diet for getting her through this.  And it clearly has done wonders for her skin and coat.  Added bonus, the food actually smells good with minimal odor as opposed to the cheapy stuff which made me gaggy.\",\n",

Did she wolf down the Newman's the first time I gave it to her? No.  Just like us, it took time to retrain her palate and appreciate the lack of salt and msg, artificial flavors and colors, and to relearn better eating habits.  Two years down the road, she is allergy free, healthy, energetic and has a beautiful coat.<br />Highly recommended.\",\n",

       " \"We have 2 cats. One is 7 and the other is 16. We wanted a healthier food for our cats and dog so when I saw an ad in a magazine for this food I got online and researched it more. There happened to be a coupon in the paper that week so I went to our pet store to buy some. I must admit I was shocked at the price and almost didn't buy it because even with a $5.00 off coupon it is way more than I was used to spending. I am so glad I didn't back off and continue with our old brand. I saw a huge difference in the cats in just a few days. Our 16 year old cat, who normally laid around all day and couldn't jump up on our fireplace mantel (her favorite napping spot on the winter) anymore was racing through the house and playing with our other cat. She is now able to jump up on high places again. Hairballs have virtually disappeared and we very rarely have them throwing up anymore, which was almost a daily occurance in our household. I have tried a few of the other Blue Buffalo varieties and as long as they are chicken my cats love them. Sometimes I mix the Blue Wilderness with the Blue Regular for more nutrients. My only complaint is, I wish they had trial sizes because my cats normally hate any cat food with fish, but I would love to see if they would eat the Blue Buffalo kind. All in all if I could give this a 10 star I would. I know this a rating for the cat food, but we are just as pleased with the dog food. And as for the price.. you don't have to feed your animals as much because there are no fillers so for us the price evened out because I don't have to buy it as often.\",\n",

Now they are in the same glut as all the other \"designer\" dog foods that have ridiculous price tags. Didn\\'t you hear?...people are getting rid of their pets because they can\\'t afford to feed them and this company is of no help. Unbelievable! Well, By Nature, you lost my business. If your dog food is the same high price and quality as 10 million others, there is absolutely no reason to buy it. Didn\\'t your marketing people tell you that? or did they just take your money? Lucky for my dog, I found another well-known, high quality dog food that I will purchase instead.',\n",

I buy a high quality dog food, it\\'s ingredients contain everything my vet wants me to be feeding me dogs. I also wanted to get them some special treats. But in my haste I picked up a bag of these \"gourmet\" chicken breast treats.  Usually I read the label on everything I give my dogs.  Not this time, they looked healthy and were very similar to other chicken breast treats I normally buy.  Had I carefully read the back of the bag I would have immediately returned them to the shelf and moved on.  The words on the back of the bag \"not for human consumption, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling this product\"-\"made in China\" would have tipped me off!!!  I never saw these warnings until after my beloved jack russell became very ill only mere hours after eating one of these treats.  My vet wanted to know what had she eaten that was different?  I handed him the bag-he looked it over in horror.  My dog developed an obstruction from the treat, which caused bloat because nothing could pass, salmonella and e-coli poisoning, and an infection in her heart giving her a 4/6 heart murmur.  She had to undergo expoloratory surgery, 7 sets of xrays, 2 ultrasounds, multiple blood tests,an ecg and we\\'re not done yet.  She is still in recovery, tests still pending.  This was one of the healthiest dogs my vet cared for before this incident.  Never had a health issue in the past, never a heart murmur.  At 9 years old most people thought she was 3 or 4.  I have been told the heart murmur has been caused by the infection settling in her heart, which is now irreversable.  Which means if she makes it through all of this her life expectancy just went from 16+ to 10 or 11.<br />My vet cultured one of the treats and could not believe what disease and bacteria it was loaded with.  I cannot believe I took such good care of her for 9 years and then put her through all of this suffering because I didn\\'t take the time to carefully look the product over. Thank you, Cadet and IMS Pet Products for contributing to my dog\\'s pain and suffering.',\n",

The ingredient list is commendable with no fillers and none of those horrendous animal scraps found in cheaper dog foods. Mostly I like seeing the inclusion of potatoes in the mix. We like the density of the canned food; those runny canned products with high liquid content tend to dirty and stain the canine whiskers and beard. One user of Artemis commented that her dog had much less gas and fewer stools. I'll have to monitor our girls more closely to see if this is the case with them.

I bought this 5 lb. bag as treats to sprinkle on her more nutritional mainstay brand or to hand feed because she loved the one from the pet store so much.

I have to say that I have seen good reviews on the ingredients of this dog food, but I cannot say I notice anything in particular about my dogs since changing other than they seem to enjoy it more and seem to be satisfied with less of it.  Perhaps one dog who has skin problems is better, but I can't swear the dog food is the cause.  So, relying almost entirely on internet proclamation of quality, I give this a hearty recommendation.

That said, in terms of dog food, it's important to find a food made of fresh ingredients with no corn byproducts.<br /><br />My little guy eats a bowl of this per day and he has cured the constipation problem he was having before we switched foods.  He seems to really like the taste and to make it a little easier on his teeth, I add water to it to soften it.  That seems to do the trick since the kibbles are decent sized and might be a bit much for a smaller dog to take on.<br /><br />What's also nice about this is ordering through Amazon Prime and getting the heavy bag shipped for free to my door with two-day shipping.  This is by far the most reasonable price I've come across for a top-brand dog food.  Try a smaller bag to see if your pup takes to it and go from there.\",\n",

It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough.

He hasn't vomited at all or had diarrhea. His coat has gotten so much shinier and he seems to be a much happier dog without all the tummy issues!\",\n",
       " \"I have 2 schanuzers, one has great skin one has serious skin allergies. When we adopted them they were eating kibbles and bits, and the one with bad skin looked horrible. I hate to say it, but I didn't even like petting him.<br /><br />We went to the vet and spoke to a nutirentest, they gave us some small samples for each dog to try and find out which brand of dog food they liked the best. Turns out they both loved the natures balance.<br /><br />I chose the fish and sweet potato flavor since most dogs that have alleriges are also allergic to chicken and rice. We have been using this dog food for almost 3 months and I have seen a dramtic change in both of their coats!<br /><br />The one with great skin, is even softer and shiner. But the one with bad skin has had the most change. He has a beasutiful shiney dark black coat. He has completly stopped itching and all the bumps are gone.<br /><br />I cannot say enough good things about this food!\",\n",
       " 'Natural Balance Sweet Potatoe and Fish is awesome.  Since eating this my cocker spaniel has not had anymore ear infections!!  He loves the food and it has benefited him greatly.  Would recommend this dog food!!',\n",
       " \"My Golden is my heart.  And she has allergies, and with a Golden ear infections are very possible.  Switching to a limited ingredient dog food has been a huge positive.  And, she loves this stuff.  Give the option of a few dog foods, she'll go to this one and bark for it.  Her weight has remained consistent since the switch, btw.  I do recommend it.  For those on a budget, I would add: this flavor (as opposed to their Venison and/or Bison flavors) tends to be about five dollars cheaper; stalking the items price fluctuations tends to save another five.  This size bag is about a six week supply for us, I think.  The plus side to ordering is that you can get the bigger bag, and someone else carries it to your door.  However, if you have a local business in your area that stocks this (I don't, but my Mom does) they will probably load it for you.  And the local Natural Dog Food store actually gives samples.  Anywhoo, wherever you buy, I think this is a product worth trying.\",\n",
       " 'Be cautious about all store dog foods. My dog had been eating Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Fish and developed digestive issues and almost died.  I thought it was a number of things. Had lots of tests run and then one of my clients dogs developed the same issues with his dog on the same dog food and has also spent a lot of money trying to correct the gut issue. Can\\'t prove anything as we got rid of the dog food, but since they recalled their Sweet Potato and Chicken this year because of (see below)...Posted: Jun 21, 2010 at 4:00 PM [Jun 21, 2010]<br /><br />In 2007, a pet food recall was issued after the FDA discovered that vegetable proteins imported from China that were used to produce pet foods were contaminated with melamine. Sadly, some animals were sickened, and even died. After this recall, it\\'s fair to say that many of us had become even more aware of how the pet food industry is regulated and how lapses are corrected, which is a great thing. Knowledge is power, as the saying goes.<br /><br />The FDA posted a new announcement for a voluntary pet food recall on June 18 - relating to Natural Balance Pet Foods, Inc. More specifically, the company discovered that there was the possibility of salmonella contamination in 5- and 28-pound bags of their Sweet Potato and Chicken Dry Dog Food. Consumers who have purchased that formula need to look for a \"best by\" date of June 17, 2011.<br /><br />Flickr photo courtesy of Denise Chan<br />Salmonella, also referred to as salmonellosis, causes digestive problems, and dogs will typically present with fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and weakness. Other symptoms can occur.<br />Salmonella is a zoonotic disease, meaning that it can be passed to humans as well, so care needs to be taken. Hand washing is a must - even when handling dry pet food that may be contaminated with the bacteria.<br /><br />To keep up to date with current recalls and information on pet food safety, visit the FDA\\'s website to view the updated list that includes not only dog and cat foods, but also horse feed.<br /><br />[...]',\n",
       " 'I have a Jack Russell Terrier. It has an allergic reaction to chicken and some grains.  This food seems to have solved most if not all of its allergy problems.  The dog had chewed itself raw.  After a couple of weeks of this dog food, hair was growing back with only occasional scratching.  Nothing like it use to be.  I gave it 5 stars because it worked.  Would my dog rather have burger or steak... yes.  But, it does eat this.  I order a bag a week and a half before I run out.  Not as cheap as regular dog food, but saves on the Vet bills.  Fifty dollars a bag for the dog food, versus a minimum, $150 for a visit to the Vet.',\n",
       " \"I was very happy with this product at first, as it solved my little dog's skin problems. Now, almost 2 years later, my dog has developed really bad cough allergy. I have solidly confirmed the food is the root cause by stopping & trying it again. I just want to mention that this is a 2nd time we have to discontinue dog food after years of use, due to newly developed allergies.\",\n",
       " \"Great dog food.  My 2.5 year old lab is at a healthier weight after a year on this (she was 90 lbs as a 1.5 year old pup, and she's slimmed down to 80.  But she's a very large lab, so she wasn't really fat to begin with).  Also, I don't wanna get too graphic, but there is evidence on our walks that she's digesting this better than the grocery store food I used to give her.<br /><br />(I started her on this because we suspected a food allergy, and then I liked the results.)<br /><br />But why is it going up in price?  I've been buying it off Amazon because, with Prime, it's cost effective.  But it was $50 in February, $55 in March, and now $60 in April?  What gives??  I might have to start buying it at the brick-and-mortar store again.  And that's a shame, because having a month's worth of dog food delivered to your door is pretty awesome.\",\n",
       " \"My french bulldog developed SEVERE allergies at around 8 months.  Within a few weeks he was covered in bumps from head-to-toe, his hair fell out, he wheezed horribly, had really bad gas, went to the bathroom a lot and had loose stools.  I wasn't sure he would live, and the Vet said he had severe allergies, probably to his food, and put him on several months of prednisone and a prescription allergy food.  I was upset with the prednisone treatment as I knew it was dangerous and my dog hated the prescription food.  Two weeks later there was almost no change and he was still miserable, so I started researching my own solution for allergies, comparing food ingredients, and ideas to try.  I found that salmon/fish and sweet potatoes are not ingredients found in many other dog foods so an allergy to them would be more rare...and this food doesn't contain any grains or poultry products.  I started him on this and added a heaping spoon of canned pink salmon with it, and he still licks the bowl clean every time.  His breathing started clearing up within a week or so and I was able to stop giving him prednisone.  The bumps gradually went away after about a month and a half and his hair slowly grew back.  It took about 4+ months for 100% of his symptoms to go away, but he has been doing great for over a year now.  (For treats he is only allowed raw baby carrots, apple chunks, frozen green beans, or salmon jerky.)<br /><br />This food is an excellent option for dogs with both grain and poultry allergies as I can't seem to find another quality dog food that doesn't contain a little bit of chicken or rice, eggs, oatmeal, etc.  My only issue is that it is a bit low on protein, but since I add canned salmon to his food each day anyway isn't a problem for us.  The canned salmon and salmon oil are good for his skin so it works nicely, especially since he will eat the dry dog food just fine, but when I add the canned salmon he goes nuts for it.<br /><br />If your dog has allergies, try this!!  Don't let the vet sell you prescription dog food and put your dog on dangerous doses of prednisone.  My vet put my dog on the most common one sold; it was really expensive and I was so upset after I researched it and discovered that it has almost zero nutritional value.  (Look at petfoodanalysis. com as it does an amazing job of reviewing all foods and ranking them on quality ingredients, etc.)\",\n",
